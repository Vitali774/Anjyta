this week we have open AI shipping
0:01
updates through the desktop app a open-
0:03
source version of Cloud's artifacts and
0:05
more releases within the generative AI
0:07
world that you can actually put to work
0:09
today now if I look or sound a little
0:10
under the weather that's because I am I
0:12
just got back from speaking at a
0:14
conference in Denmark and I also held a
0:15
really exciting workshop on how to
0:17
generate your personal context and build
0:19
assistance but unfortunately it didn't
0:20
bring the appropriate clothing for the
0:22
cold weather there so I caught a little
0:24
cold so I've been sipping my tea as I've
0:26
been preparing this video but no minor
0:28
sickness is going to stop me from
0:29
showing you all the new releases in the
0:31
AI space that you can put to work today
0:32
in this week's episode of AI news you
0:34
can use let's get into it so first
ChatGPT App Updates
0:36
things first we have a very interesting
0:38
update coming out of open AI for the
0:40
chat GPT app namely it can now work
0:43
together with other applications for the
0:45
very first time up until now you could
0:46
give it screenshots but it couldn't
0:48
really see what an app was doing on your
0:50
computer this is something that's pretty
0:52
exciting because it has been demoed when
0:53
they first showed of advanced voice
0:55
assistant back in May the way it works
0:57
is the following you just need to update
0:58
your application which you can do up
1:00
here check for updates and I already did
1:02
this so I have the newest version of the
1:04
chat GPT app right here and it's this
1:06
new button here and you might not see it
1:07
right away because it only works with
1:09
specific applications it's the code
1:11
editing ones okay this is not available
1:13
for all apps yet but surely over time
1:16
they will expand the compatibility of
1:17
this but as of now you could work with
1:19
various code editors like the terminal
1:21
or vs code here and it pulls in all the
1:23
code inside of them into its context
1:25
window and you can have one conversation
1:27
with all of it this is pretty amazing
1:29
and again if you you don't see this
1:30
button you might need to open up one of
1:31
these applications so let me open up
1:33
terminal right here and when I'm in
1:34
terminal I just open up a new cat GPT
1:37
window by clicking the icon of the
1:38
desktop app and then here I can add
1:40
terminal if you're doing it for the
1:41
first time you're going to need to give
1:42
it permission on a Mac and now I can
1:44
tell Cat GPT things like navigates to my
1:46
download folder and it will look inside
1:49
of my terminal and tell me exactly what
1:51
code to type in there and I don't need
1:53
to know various bash commands by heart
1:55
to navigate this that's the language
1:57
that the terminal operates in so just
1:59
copy paste what it tells me here hit
2:00
enter and boom we're situated inside of
2:03
the downloads folder with this quick
2:04
little command I could see all the files
2:06
in there this is great now here's the
2:08
interesting part you can add other apps
2:09
to it okay so if I activate this also
2:12
for text edit for example then I could
2:14
start a new text edit document and I add
2:17
text edit here and now all of this code
2:19
and all of this code is in a context
2:22
window of my cat GPT conversation now
2:24
this really makes sense if you're
2:25
building an application inside of vs
2:26
code but you want to use the terminal to
2:28
do something different like accessing
2:30
get T repo and again this is just the
2:31
beginning surely over time we will get
2:33
more applications in here and eventually
2:35
I'm looking forward to a r where it just
2:37
sees the screen 24/7 if I give it access
2:39
to it that's when the advanced voice is
2:41
really going to shine because you're
2:42
going to be doing your work and it's
2:44
going to see all the applications and
2:46
once you need something you just press a
2:47
button and tell chat GB what you want to
2:49
do no need to give it the context
2:51
because it has it already oh and there's
2:53
also one more update to the app and that
2:54
is the fact that it's now available to
2:56
all windows users so if you're on
2:57
Windows you can go over to this link and
2:59
you can download downloaded for Windows
3:01
finally they rolled this out so
3:02
everybody can use the desktop app now
3:04
and I expect more updates to show up
3:05
here very soon because not really news
3:07
you can use but I did want to highlight
3:09
the fact that Greg Brockman is actually
3:10
back at open aai and we had a discussion
3:12
with the team on how peculiar this
3:14
timing is the year is about to wrap up
3:16
Thanksgiving and Christmas is coming up
3:17
and he's rejoining the company now what
3:19
do they have planned what are they going
3:21
to ship that they need Greg there to
3:22
communicate remember he was always the
3:24
use case guy he always tweeted a lot and
3:26
showed people how to use the various
3:28
things they shipped so I think the fact
3:29
that it came on now will coincide with
3:31
some releases over the coming weeks or
3:33
months I'm thinking probably 01 full is
3:35
the main thing that people are talking
3:38
about here we'll report on it as soon as
Chatbase
3:40
it's here okay so by now you probably
3:42
know that I really like chat GPT and
3:43
especially the gpts that it provides
3:46
they're limited but if you customize
3:48
them they're quite powerful and today I
3:49
have both good and bad news for you and
3:51
if you've been following the channel you
3:53
also know we use notion a lot but gpts
3:55
and notion aren't exactly friends
3:57
there's no easy way to have a notion
3:59
page that you keep updating and all of
4:01
that info going into your chatbot
4:02
automatically that was the bad news now
4:04
here's the good news there's a platform
4:06
that does this connection extremely well
4:08
and that is chatbase the sponsor of
4:09
today's video chatbase is a platform
4:11
that lets you create external facing
4:13
chat Bots like customer service agents
4:15
lead acquisition bot or what excited me
4:17
personally about this is that you can
4:18
create internal chat Bots that are
4:20
connected to a notion page that you
4:22
might be updating anyway so for example
4:24
for these videos we curate all of this
4:26
weg's research inside of a database we
4:29
call it the AI use case database and we
4:31
keep updating it every single day of the
4:33
week now by connecting that page to a
4:35
bot on chat base we can just talk to it
4:38
and draft social media posts summarize
4:40
all of this week's news or search over
4:42
the entire database in no time and this
4:45
is so easy to set up you can do this
4:46
yourself and Link any sort of knowledge
4:48
that you might be collecting somewhere
4:50
to your own version of chat GPT to get
4:52
started with chatbase yourself click the
4:54
link at the top of the description to
4:55
try chatbase today and now let's move on
4:58
to the next piece of AI news that you
4:59
can use okay next up a brand new tool
Prompt Improver
5:01
from mopic this one will be very brief
5:03
because we talked about this before
5:05
matter of fact we even build something
5:07
that does exactly this improving your
5:09
prompts we made it freely available in
5:11
the GPT store it's called Sam The Prompt
5:13
Creator and people are using this thing
5:15
look at it it has over 32,000 chats and
5:17
I don't even promote it on the channel I
5:19
created one video about it a few months
5:21
back this works like a charm but now I'm
5:23
Fric also caught onto the fact that
5:25
actually improving prompts is something
5:26
that can be super useful especially if
5:28
you're going to be using the prompt a
5:29
lot or you're going to place it inside
5:31
of an automation all you need to do is
5:32
go into the infy console here and go to
5:35
this button which is improve an existing
5:36
prompt so you can insert your prompt
5:38
here then you can use this button to
5:40
templatized Turning variables into
5:42
something that's formatted like a
5:43
variable okay instead of square brackets
5:46
as we do it they use double curly
5:47
brackets and now I can just say improve
5:49
prompt and it will use some of my
5:50
anthropic credits to improve this this
5:52
does work really well as they
5:53
implemented a six-step process here
5:56
where apparently multiple agents throw
5:57
this prompt back and forth and come up
5:59
with the very best prompt that you can
6:00
have in practice I would just say check
6:02
out what works better for you if it's
6:03
this one from aeropic or the one we
6:05
built or any other prompt improver I
6:07
would just say the following Sam The
6:09
Prompt Creator is completely free and it
6:10
has gained its popularity for a reason
6:12
it really works and you have multiple
6:14
options here so if you custom build a
6:15
prompt it's going to guide you with
6:16
leading questions to get the optimal
6:18
result whereas with mopic you really
6:20
need to know what you're looking for at
6:22
the end of the day you'll just have to
6:23
try this out just keep in mind you will
6:25
need some arobic credits for this Sam is
6:27
free your choice really good to know
6:29
this thing exists all right next up we
Qwen2.5-Coder-Artifacts
6:30
have quen 2.5 coder artifact and this is
6:33
the first open source implementation of
6:35
something like the Sonet 3.5 artifacts
6:38
feature if you're not familiar there is
6:39
the feature inside of clot that when it
6:41
creates some code it also visualizes it
6:43
and not just that it's also usable so it
6:45
looks something like this in practice I
6:46
prompted for a tic tac toe game and
6:48
there you go it creates the game that I
6:49
can now actually play all right and the
6:51
game is over see creates a code here in
6:53
the background this is the preview quen
6:55
2.5 coder works the same way now we did
6:58
a little bit of research and testing on
7:00
this and it seems that in most cases
7:02
clae 3.5 Sonet actually beats it
7:04
especially when the application is a
7:05
little more expansive but there are
7:07
specific cases like this one that we
7:09
found on Reddit where quen 2.5 coder
7:12
actually does things that son 3.5 can't
7:14
do what I'm going to do here is take
7:15
this one specific prompt that we found
7:17
on Reddit where we prompted to create a
7:19
single HTML file with free Javascript
7:21
scenes of a rotating 3D Globe I'm going
7:23
to copy paste it into here and send this
7:25
and I'm going to do the same thing
7:26
inside of a new Sonet 3.5 conversation
7:29
and there have right there you could see
7:30
quen write the code and there we go
7:32
here's the rotating globe with the
7:33
camera movement the lighting and
7:35
everything looks good it's not
7:36
interactive but we also didn't ask it to
7:38
be and instead of claw it does a limited
7:40
version it misses the texture even if I
7:41
go in and Bre prompt it to do the
7:43
texture this runs into limitations of
7:45
the tool where it can't go further than
7:47
this so this is a specific prompt that
7:49
shows off the ability of this tool and
7:51
some of the other standard ones like all
7:52
the different games and basic dashboard
7:54
websites it did not perform as well as
7:56
CLA can hold more context and it just
7:58
feels like it has more power Benchmark
8:00
suggest the same thing but again this
8:02
thing is openly available and you could
8:03
build it into your applications whereas
8:05
Sonet 3.5 with the artifacts feature not
8:07
at all you can use it through their web
8:09
app so there you go certainly an
8:10
interesting development eventually we'll
8:12
see this built into any other
8:13
application where it makes sense but
8:15
this is the in between phase where it's
8:17
not just for coders and not in
8:19
mainstream apps yet you get it inside of
8:20
claw or hugging phase demos okay the
Exolabs
8:23
next piece of news you can use is
8:24
something that just popped up on Twitter
8:27
and I thought this was super interesting
8:28
cuz I saw examples of this and now the
8:30
software that does it is open sourced
8:32
I'm talking about the ability to connect
8:33
multiple Mac minis with Thunderbolt 5 to
8:36
actually create sort of a super computer
8:37
now if you haven't seen the release the
8:39
brand new Mac minis are actually
8:40
impressive with the M4 Pro processors
8:42
they unbelievable value for the money
8:45
that they cost and just the Mac Mini
8:46
overall happens to be really efficient
8:48
when it comes to running llms but a
8:50
single Mac Mini is not going to run some
8:51
of the bigger models like the 70b models
8:54
and here they even say it can run the
8:55
Llama 405b model but if you daisy chain
8:58
four of them it works now now the piece
8:59
of software that does this is also
9:01
freely available on GitHub so anybody
9:02
who wants to do this and buy multiple
9:04
Mac minis just go into the readme here
9:06
follow these instructions or copy paste
9:07
them into chat GPT and let it guide you
9:09
through it and you're going to be able
9:10
to hook up multiple Mac Minis and build
9:12
a super computer now the big question is
9:14
here is this more cost efficient than
9:16
actually investing into a Windows
9:18
machine with multiple Nvidia graphics
9:20
cards and that's also the hot discussion
9:22
here in the comment section and Alex one
9:23
of the creators of this app actually
9:25
said they'll be following up with real
9:27
world benchmarks comparing exactly this
9:29
very soon so I can't wait to see this
9:31
myself but from the discussion here it
9:32
seems like with about $88,000 you could
9:34
run llama 405b which would be a first
9:38
the local setups that run that model
9:39
successfully are all way over $10,000 so
9:42
there you go another interesting
9:43
development in the AI space is something
9:45
you could put to work today and this is
9:47
something you should definitely consider
9:48
if you really want the privacy of
9:50
running llms locally okay then we also
Microsoft’s Multi-Agent System
9:53
have a new multi-agent framework coming
9:54
out of Microsoft which has been released
9:56
and at this point there's many of them
9:58
out there but the conclusion that
9:59
Community arrived that after costy
10:01
testing it and other people discussing
10:02
it in the comment section below is that
10:04
it's essentially like a CLA computer use
10:07
that can use other models besides Sonet
10:09
3.5 now unfortunately that doesn't mean
10:12
much because Cloud computer use just
10:14
isn't that potent we played a lot with
10:16
it I really really wanted it to work we
10:18
tested various scenarios but it's just
10:20
very inconsistent no matter how you
10:22
prompt it if you're not familiar it's
10:23
essentially AI that can remote control a
10:26
computer and perform various actions
10:28
like open Excel sheets and the browser
10:31
and do whatever you tell it to do but
10:32
it's just inconsistent it's the very
10:34
first version of it and even something
10:36
simple like filling out a form for a job
10:38
application it cannot really perform
10:40
consistently across dozens of tasks
10:42
therefore for now I would stamp it as
10:44
sort of useless while I hate to say that
10:46
it's just what we found and the rest of
10:48
the internet seems to agree and this is
10:50
an alternative to that which
10:51
unfortunately will probably also fall in
10:54
this kind of useless category but I love
10:56
to keep an eye on this stuff because
10:57
this is the next evolution of product
10:59
like chat GPT and we'll be covering this
11:01
stuff in depth as soon as more capable
11:03
versions come out if you care to see
11:04
what it can do there's several examples
11:06
here on the Microsoft website like for
11:08
example they prompted it to describe the
11:10
trends in the S&P 500 and then it goes
11:12
ahead and uses an API to fetch the
11:14
latest S&P 500 data and it runs an llm
11:17
and writes some code just to analyze the
11:19
trends and it gives you a text output
11:21
concluding that these are the some of
11:23
the latest prices and it talks about the
11:25
volatility nothing groundbreaking but
11:28
interesting to see in another one would
11:29
be finding and exporting missing
11:31
citations in a paper so this one might
11:33
be a little more practical it spawns
11:35
multiple agents like the web Surfer to
11:37
gather some context and then there's
11:38
always an orchestrator that kind of
11:40
looks at what the agents have been doing
11:42
and it reviews their tasks and then
11:44
eventually the orchestrator always gives
11:45
you back a report on what has been
11:47
accomplished again I find this
11:49
interesting but I have a very hard time
11:51
finding some proper use cases for these
11:53
outside of writing code there all these
11:54
agentic systems have proven to be really
11:56
useful in assisting users nevertheless I
11:58
wanted to to update you as now we have a
12:00
version from openi that is the simplest
12:02
one of the bunch then we have mopic with
12:04
computer use Microsoft with multiple
12:05
Frameworks like autogen and now magentic
12:07
1 and then I believe meta is the one
12:09
player that hasn't made their move in
12:11
this space yet but then there's nothing
12:12
for their consumer applications that
12:14
really Mak sense here so far so they'll
12:16
just hold out until they have something
12:17
useful I guess and that's really all I
12:19
got for this week I'm going to go drink
12:20
some tea and get some rest and I'll see
12:22
you next week with some fresh releases
