“LET’S TALK”
The problems that I have discovered to exist
between couples are either caused by sexual
dysfunction or result in sexual dysfunction. Why
is this? What is the problem?
 I believe that the number one, major issue is
lack of communication. Yet I ask, ‘How in the world
can so many people be sexually active without even
talking about sex?’ Although this may seem
obvious, you would be surprised just how easily
feelings are hurt, tempers are flared, and ego’s
bruised with the truth of sexual inadequacies and
ineptness.
 What is it we are so afraid to hear? What do we
expect? What is the basis for our fear? Honestly, I
believe that we are afraid to talk about sex openly
and truthfully, because it is a subject many may
feel unable to discuss. After all, how can we discuss
a subject of which we know so little? And why do
we not have solid, adequate, and reliable
18
SEX TALKS
information about a subject that so dramatically
and significantly affects our lives?
 The bottom line is, only nine percent of
Americans have received some kind of sex
education. Furthermore, who is to say that the nine
percent receiving sex education were presented
with information that was thorough, adequate, and
useful? I don’t know if you remember your sex
education class from elementary school, but I
certainly do. I was in the fifth grade and the boys
and girls were separated and sent to different
rooms. The girls watched a film concerning
menstruation. As to the boys, I have heard various
stories ranging from lectures on the sins of
masturbation to the prevention of conception. No
wonder we can’t talk about sex—no one seems to
be able to talk to us about it!
 It is not only the educational arena where sex
education is lacking. It is lacking within the
institution of our families as well. As I previously
mentioned, talking about sex has always been
discussed openly among my family members.
However, I have discovered that this is an anomaly.
On average, only five to ten percent of my students
and clients admit to talking to their parents about
19
sex. Most students say that their parents are
embarrassed, ashamed, or even angered by the
subject. Again, of what are we afraid?
 There are many explanations for our lack of
communication regarding sex. Whether it is within
the walls of academia or within the confines of our
own homes, sex is still considered to be a subject of
enormous controversy, sensitivity, and avoidance.
 There are some that consider the time in which
we are living to be an age of darkness. Although
the messages of sex and sexuality are pervasive
throughout our culture, many still hold the belief
that sex is dirty and bad. The message may be one
of guilt and shame.
 We are taught at a very young age that touching
our genitals or even referring to them is nasty.
Surprisingly, the issue of menstruation is still
viewed in a somewhat negative way, by both men
and women. Religious institutions set forth laws
against sex, telling us when and how sex should be
practiced, giving us firm penalties and
punishments for sexual expression.
 When sex education is provided, it is often simply
within the confines of anatomy and physiology, the
warnings of sexually transmitted diseases, and the
“LET’S TALK”
20
SEX TALKS
various methods of contraception. So we learn our
body parts, how babies are made, and how to
protect ourselves from venereal diseases.
 Then we become adults and begin to partner.
Suddenly we are thrust into a world where sex is
the norm and if we are not engaging in sexual
activity we may be considered “weird.” Yet
engaging in sexual activity may bring feelings of
shame and guilt. Girls may be labeled either by
others or by themselves, as whores or sluts if they
are sexually active and enjoy sex. Furthermore,
there seems to be a belief in our culture that girls
are undesirable if they are the ones who “put out.”
 The end result is a huge double message that
may be the basis for sexual dysfunction later on in
life. Sexual healing is now big business in America
as many of these dysfunctions are exposed. Yet,
the answer to this problem is really quite simple—
talk about sex with your partner and with your
children in an open and honest manner.
 One of the beliefs which results in an attitude of
fear, is that if we talk to our kids about sex, then
they will think we are condoning their having sex.
Many parents of teens have the belief that if they
talk to their kids about sex and discuss options for
21
birth control, then their kids will engage in sexual
activity early and frequently.
 The irony is that the research shows the opposite
result. Teenagers, who report, that when their
parents or other adults discuss sex openly with
them, are more likely to wait until they are older
to have sex. They also purport to have fewer sexual
partners. From the stories I hear from students,
our best defense against things like teen pregnancy,
sexually transmitted diseases, and casual sex is
communication. The students who shared their
stories with their classmates regarding
conversations shared with their parents about sex,
were perhaps only able to do so because of the
freedom and comfort they felt from their families.
 I am not laying blame or placing guilt on parents
or teachers. The veil around sex has been
enshrouded in secrecy and mystery for a very long
time, at least in American society. The bottom line
is that no one is to blame and we are all
responsible!
 Let us take a brief look at some of the sexual
issues we face as a nation. Americans have an
exceptionally high teenage pregnancy rate.
Statistics show that one out of every four people
“LET’S TALK”
22
SEX TALKS
have a sexually transmitted disease, with new
discoveries of viruses and bacteria’s almost yearly.
The incidence of extramarital affairs is stunningly
high, and only thirty to forty percent of sexually
active women claim to achieve an orgasm during
sex. Viagra sales are astronomical and one has to
wonder why men are no longer able to obtain and
maintain erections.
 As if all of this isn’t bad enough, perhaps one of
the biggest travesties is what I hear women saying
about their own bodies. For some insane reason,
women are still not looking at their genitals nor
are they touching themselves in an effort to fully
know their bodies and to discover what brings them
sexual pleasure.
 Masturbation is still viewed as dirty and
shameful by some and as an indulgence leading to
sin by others. We go to great lengths to avoid the
scents, the tastes, and the sights of our own bodies
and those of our partners.
 In our bus-I-ness of life, filled with cellular
phones, quick trips and fast foods, we have also
created “kentucky fried sex.” We take the parts and
pieces that we like the best, avoid the others, choose
either original, crispy, or spicy and consume it while
23
it’s fresh and hot. As a quick fix this may work
well, but as a steady diet, this meal may become
tasteless, monotonous, and well—just plain boring.
 Yes, I understand that life is moving at speeds
where time is precious. And, yes, I know that we
all have deadlines to meet, places to go, and careers
to build. The problem is that, in our time
constraints, we want quick sex and we expect it to
be fully satisfying and fulfilling. However, when
sex is attached to time constraints, the results may
be that you or your partner may not reach orgasm,
or the man ejaculates too quickly. Both may feel
that sex is an issue of performance, not enjoyment.
 Perhaps part of what we are most missing in
our sexual relationships is our ability to see the
whole chicken, and to savor each wet, juicy, and
flavorful bite. What is needed is the act of presence,
which may be defined as the ability to see, hear,
smell, taste, and touch with conscious deliberation
and awareness.
 Some believe that the first time one has sex with
a partner is the best time. If this is true, wouldn’t
we want to recreate the newness and the freshness
and the flavor of sex with each union? What if sex
simply improves with the passage of time? What if
“LET’S TALK”
24
SEX TALKS
we could experience whole body orgasms rather
than just partial ones? If you believed that great
sex was the glue to holding a marriage together,
then wouldn’t you make attempts to be a better
sexual partner?
If you answer “yes,” then please read on, as we
will take it from the beginning—the moment of first
sight when our hearts pound wildly and our
thoughts of our beloved fill our days and nights
with anticipation, excitement, and lustful fantasies.
25
CHAPTER TWO
FIRST THINGS
FIRST
A couple walks into the office of a sex therapist.
They begin to discuss their various issues of
concern, and almost immediately, two separate
issues emerge. He says the amount of sex is limited
and lacking; she says that her emotional needs are
not being met and that sex is unsatisfying.
 Okay, so here we are with two valid concerns. It
seems fairly clear that neither partner is meeting
each other’s needs in the relationship. The
complaints voiced by this couple are ones that
therapists have heard many, many times. The
question is, ‘How do couples get to this point?’
Certainly this couple felt they were sexually
compatible at some point in their relationship.
 I would like to present a model that I think
explains much of what we experience as we move
through the process of partnering. Please bear in
mind it is only one model among the zillions that
are currently used. I believe that the value is found
26
SEX TALKS
in its simplicity and logic and that this particular
model applies to many couples.
 Let’s start at the beginning. We see our beloved
for the very first time. Ah! Our eyes meet, our blood
begins to flow, our heart rate increases, our
respiratory rate increases, and well, you
know…Now, this is what I call the “as good as it
gets” moment. Think of this as the top of a U. We
begin on the top of the left side—this is the pinnacle
of the moment. The moment we believe that love
will exist forever.
 In the arena of human relationships we call this
“passionate love.” It is a love (or “lust?”) that creates
feelings of heat and passion throughout our bodies?
It is that part of love that we believe tears down
walls, extends beyond time and space, owns our
hearts, souls and minds, and makes others remark
that we are glowing.
 We believe that love will last forever. Feelings
of love take us to the top of the highest peak where
be believe that nothing, absolutely nothing, can
bring us down.
 Physical attraction is the initial motivator that
brings two individuals together. The attraction is
validated as both partners may begin to move
27
toward each other in an effort to engage in
conversation. If the attraction continues, then for
the next several days, weeks, and even months,
the couple begins to build a relationship.
 During this initial phase, still at the top of the
U but moving downward a bit, each person engages
in what we often refer to as “courting” behavior.
Each is trying to impress the other as they put their
“best face” forward. It is very normal mating
behavior. I use the word “mating” here because this
is really the ultimate goal.
 At this point in the relationship, we wish for
our beloved to see the very best of who and what
we are.
This behavior is not malicious or manipulative,
it is simply not exactly one that reflects selfdisclosure or the exposure of one’s motives or
intentions.
 The first days and weeks of any new relationship
can be defined as “magical.” It is a time when
neither can get enough of the other. We think of no
one and nothing else besides our beloved. Our heart
races at the sight, smell, touch, and taste of our
newfound love. We can think of nothing else, lose
FIRST THINGS FIRST
28
SEX TALKS
all concentration, and find that we are filling our
days and nights with only thoughts of our new love.
 The passionate phase of our love has even been
shown to improve our health. Our immune systems
become stronger and the energy we feel seems to
help create a renewed strength and vitality.
 So what contributes to this “magical” time of
passionate love? I believe that it is the art of
“presence.” This is a time of newness and
excitement when we find ourselves hanging on
every word spoken by our beloved. We gaze into
his or her eyes as we wish for them to know how
interested we are in everything they are saying and
doing. Romance is very much alive and well, and
love is not just in the air—it is everywhere!
 Time moves on and we find ourselves moving
down the U toward the three month mark. Sexual
connection can be experienced as early as the first
date, and in most cases, occurs prior to the third
month mark. Communication has most likely been
frequent, although void of any real meaning and
significance. Topics such as personal beliefs, sexual
histories, and past relationships may not be
discussed, as each person wishes for the air of magic
and mystery to linger as long as possible.
29
 At this early stage of the relationship, it is not
likely that a couple views their beloved as a
spiritual being. The physical aspect is most
prominently explored, particularly within the first
three months. I would love to say that at this point
the couple is experiencing completely satisfying sex
and that they will live happily ever after! However,
I can’t…because unfortunately patterns begin to
form in the early phases of the relationship, that
ultimately lead toward the door marked “Sex
Therapy.”
 These patterns are created from the many
interpersonal dynamics occurring in the first three
months of a relationship. Many of these dynamics
are based on the level of education, information,
and personal experiences of each partner, regarding
relationships and sex. The patterns that evolve
from these experiences are the ones that I will share
with you based on what I believe to be true.
 In many ways, the first three months are spent
as if in a dream. The couples are exploring each
other on many different levels. It is my
understanding that many young couples may
experience sex in the initial stage of the
relationship, often very soon after meeting.
FIRST THINGS FIRST
30
SEX TALKS
 The magic and wonder experienced in the early
stages of a relationship exist because the couple
feels the newness of being together. Think back to
the feelings you had when you first met and began
dating your partner. Remember the butterflies?
Remember how your body ached at the thought of
being touched, kissed, and caressed?
 Now let’s continue moving down the U to the
six month period. Typically, between three and six
months, if the couple is still together, they will
continue to smooth out the rough spots. The degree
of difficulty may be equivalent to the degree of
sexual satisfaction found between the couple. If the
sex is good, then this time period may be less
dramatic. If not, it can be an extremely difficult
time, and often a couple will make the split soon
after the three month mark.
 For those of you who are now saying that
relationships are more than sex, I agree! But
remember that we are looking at patterns and
many would agree that sex does occur in the
beginning of most relationships. Therefore, the
sexual patterns that develop in a relationship tend
to form within the first three to six months. These
patterns may include; lack of communication, the
31
faking of orgasms, sexual ineptness, unrealistic
expectations, and attitudes suggesting complacency
and metiocracy.
 These patterns are based on much of what we
have previously discussed. Bear in mind that many
partners engage in sexual activity very early in
their relationship. Then remember that each
person has about an eighty percent chance of never
having had any sex education. Add to this recipe
the fact that approximately fifty percent of women
do not know what pleases them. Finally, mix in
the statistic that tells us seventy percent of all
women do not experience orgasms during
intercourse. Stir in the realization that each person
is trying to please the other in an effort to “seal”
the relationship and keep the other person’s
interest. The whole thing truly becomes a recipe
for disaster.
 As the couple reaches the three month period,
several interesting things seem to surface. First,
the devotion, attention, and “presence” begin to
fade. The “best face” mask is removed and suddenly
we begin to see the flaws. Where once our beloved
could do no wrong, now we find ourselves becoming
critical, demanding, and dissatisfied. As this
FIRST THINGS FIRST
32
SEX TALKS
intensifies, arguments ensue, criticism is voiced,
and anger and tears regularly flow.
 Now then, if a couple makes it to the six month
mark (the bottom of our proverbial U), an upswing
is usually experienced. The couple may begin to
self-disclose feelings and beliefs as the masks are
removed and real feelings are discussed. As couples
progress upward and onward, a variety of possible
end results may occur. The couple may find
themselves planning a wedding, they may outgrow
each other and part ways, or as is most likely the
case, one or the other chooses to take his or her
affection elsewhere. And guess what? Both find
themselves either immediately or eventually back
at the top of the U, and thus it begins again.
 Those couples who marry may become somewhat
dismayed as they once again experience the U,
when their wedding marks that “as good as it gets”
moment. The bottom is then reached the day they
decide to divorce or perhaps make an appointment
to see a sex therapist that can tell them why they
haven’t touched each other or had sex in years.
What happened? Why did they lose the beauty,
wonder, and magic of those first three months?
33
 Let us address these questions one at a time.
Perhaps what happened is that a couple based their
relationship on only the physical attraction they
first felt for each other. Being physically attracted
to your partner is definitely important. However,
long-term relationships need much more than this
to ensure their longevity. Also, not every
relationship entered into is meant to last forever.
Yet, if this is your goal, then much work is to be
done to ensure a successful outcome. And if
longevity is your goal, then the following chapter
may provide insights as we explore and attempt to
answer the question, “What went wrong?”
FIRST THINGS FIRST
34
SEX TALKS
CHAPTER THREE
SO WHAT WENT
WRONG?
Nothing and everything. Nothing because the
couple was only doing what fifty percent of every
American couple does—meet, fall in love, marry,
and then divorce. And, of the remaining fifty
percent? Well, how many truly happy couples do
you know? So, in a sense, much is wrong with the
way we partner in this country. But what model
do we have? Our media portrays romance, sex, and
love as a shake and bake process—we meet and
then have sex. Bored and or dissatisfied in your
relationship? Well then, just shake and bake again,
and again, and again. Eventually we’ll get it right,
won’t we?
 According to statistics ninety percent of
American adults marry. Fifty percent of these
marriages end in divorce. From the fifty percent
that divorce, ninety percent will remarry and of
those ninety percent, fifty percent will divorce
35
again. So the shaking may be working, but the
baking is just getting us burnt.
 Is it really that difficult to stay together? What
is the key to a happy and satisfying life as a couple?
Those couples reporting high levels of satisfaction
in their marriages report active and satisfying sex
lives. By “active,” I mean three or four times a week,
with both partners reaching orgasm. These couples
say that their communication regarding sexual
pleasuring is open and that they are very honest
about what they want from each other. Sounds
fairly simple doesn’t it? I would have thought so,
too. Yet, I have discovered that this is much more
difficult than what I would have ever imagined it
to be.
 Some of the difficulty is based on the inability
to explain to our partners the expectations that we
have regarding sex. Men and women may
experience different wants and needs. The issue of
intimacy may be an example of this difference.
Many women may desire a bond with their partner
and a connection that is truly unique from what
they have with others. To a woman, this may
symbolize intimacy. In addition, women may need
more time to become aroused as the statement “Sex
SO WHAT WENT WRONG?
36
SEX TALKS
is in the brain,” seems to be more true for women
than for men. Although, I do hear from a few older
men (and perhaps wiser in many ways) that sex is
just as much a “mind matter” for them as they
believe it is for women. They tell me that it is not
unusual for a woman to be “ready” much more
quickly and readily than they are, and that shared
intimacy is also the very heart of their sexual
experiences.
 However, at this point it may be necessary to be
somewhat gender-specific. To some extent, I believe
that men and women do not share the same sexual
ideology. Differences may be due to the socialization
processes involving gender identity. Men and
women think differently about sex because we are
raised to think differently. For example,
masturbation is common and a normal process of
being a male. For females, masturbation is just
something girls don’t do. And if they do, they
certainly don’t talk about it.
 The lack of exploration and touching of one’s
genitals are linked with one’s feelings of sexual selfesteem and sexual knowledge of one’s body
regarding pleasuring. Within the category of the
thirty percent of women reaching orgasm, the
37
majority said they are not afraid to look at their
genitals and touch them. These actions greatly
increase the likelihood that a woman will
experience increased sexual satisfaction, open
communication regarding all sexual issues, and
achieve orgasms on a regular basis.
 At this point in time, one would think we have
long passed the point where masturbation is taboo.
Yet we haven’t. So why not? What is the problem?
The problem is still largely a result of the ways in
which women view themselves. Much of this
perception is gained through media influence. Also,
we must consider the ways of socialization, which
greatly define for us “how things came to be this
way.” Here we see a strong Judeo-Christian
influence of the Church where masturbation is
prohibited. If one is raised in a family where sex is
believed to be “dirty” and “bad,” then sometimes
these attitudes are present throughout one’s
lifetime. After all, it is a bit difficult to enjoy sex if
we don’t know what brings us pleasure and if sexual
guilt blocks our ability to enjoy sex. But there are
more pieces to this puzzle that may further
complicate and inhibit a woman’s ability to find
sexual pleasure and ultimately lead her to orgasm.
SO WHAT WENT WRONG?
38
SEX TALKS
 I think we may all agree that the media plays a
large part in creating our perceptions of American
life. Embedded in these perceptions are standards
by which we have come to judge others and
ourselves. This is profoundly the case regarding
physical beauty, and the damage it does affects
mostly women.
 We are bombarded with continual displays of
beauty on the television and in magazines. The
standards to which we measure ourselves are
perfection, and falsely presented to us as attainable
results. We are presented with women portraying
flawless skin, hair, and bodies; large, rounded
breasts; small waists; tight butts and absolutely
no sign of cellulite anywhere. How can we feel good
about ourselves when we see nothing but perfection
to show us just how imperfect we are. I am not
blaming the media, I am simply stating an issue
concerning women that I know contributes to lack
of self-esteem and sexual pleasure. The bottom line
is that it is a little hard to enjoy sex when one is
concerned with breast size, tummy rolls, and
cellulite.
 At this point, you may be laughing at the
absurdity of these statements. As ridiculous as it
39
all may sound, it is absolutely true. After nine years
of teaching, I am sorry to say that we really haven’t
“come a long way baby.” Women are still covering
their bodies, still having sex only in the dark, and
are still not reaching orgasm. There’s just too much
going on in our brains—too many beautiful women
to which we compare ourselves. Too much selfcriticism and judgment; too much guilt and shame;
and, not enough letting go, giving up, and giving
in which would allow for pleasure.
 I spoke to you about the openness of my
communication with my grandmother. There really
wasn’t anything we couldn’t talk about and sex was
certainly at the top of her list. Perhaps one of the
reasons for my passion and drive to write this book
in the first place is due to what I know about my
grandmother. You see, my grandmother passed
away in her late eighties, never having experienced
orgasm. And believe me, she never stopped
thinking about it or desiring the experience. This
seems almost criminal, and yet it is hardly an
anomaly—it is much more common than you would
ever imagine.
 I say we haven’t really come very far and yet in
many ways I must admit that we have. Once it
SO WHAT WENT WRONG?
40
SEX TALKS
was believed that sexual pleasure was only for men.
In fact, in America during the 1800’s, if a woman
was caught enjoying sex or masturbating she was
often chastised through public ridicule or physical
punishment. At least most of us might agree that
sex is a pleasurable experience to be shared by both
men and women.
 After all, if sex were not to be a pleasurable
experience for a woman, then why would it be that
the clitoris is the only organ on the body that is
purely for pleasure? In addition to clitoral orgasms,
women also report having vaginal orgasms. So we
also get more for our bang! Yet, I reiterate the fact
that only about thirty percent of all women in this
country experience any type of orgasm.
 Okay, enough about women. What about you
guys? Although almost all of say you masturbate
and reach orgasm regularly, you too, are reporting
sexual dissatisfaction within your relationships.
Why? Some report lack of erection, although Viagra
has certainly solved this crisis. And yes, it is a crisis
or we wouldn’t see Viagra sales skyrocketing to the
extent that they have.
 One of the issues facing men is that of
performance. In our culture, we make jokes about
41
the “two minute man” and impotency may be
viewed as a man lacking desire, hiding latent
homosexual tendencies, or simply not interested
in sex. The reasons for impotency are many and at
the top of the list may be an intense pressure to
perform. Although there is a myth in our culture
that men do not care about their partner’s ability
to achieve orgasm, from the hundreds of men I have
spoken with from “Human Sexuality” only one, has
said he does not care.
 No wonder Viagra is so important to men. If we
expect them to have erections and to stay hard for
a certain amount of time, this certainly would add
to the pressure they feel to “perform.” The best way
to avoid feelings of expectation and performance is
to TALK about what you want, need, or desire from
your sexual experience. We seem to remember the
“show” part of our kindergarten “show and tell”
days, but I think the “tell” is the most important
part.
 As previously mentioned, the main complaints
from men are, sexual frequency (they want it more
often), and lack of oral sex (getting it, not giving
it). In regards to the former, by this time it should
be clear that if women aren’t enjoying sex and
SO WHAT WENT WRONG?
42
SEX TALKS
reaching orgasm, they sure are not going to be
engaging in sexual activity often. Concerning the
latter issue—well, I have much to say in this arena!
Engaging in oral sex behavior has to do with
personal and sexual ideology and is again reflected
through a mindset that desires to label sexual acts
as “dirty” and “bad.” There will be much more about
this particular sex act in Chapter Five.
 Although more women may be able to relate to
the above statements about body image, I believe
it is something that also affects many men. For a
long time the media focused on woman and issues
that were only germane to them. However, we are
now seeing advertisements that show “hot” women
falling for guys with sculptured abdomens and tight
buttocks. Magazines are depicting men with
muscles—void of body hair. Then of course, mention
must be made to the television sitcoms, comedians,
and advertisements, all of which purport that “size
matters.” The size of a man’s penis has become part
of the “mad market” to convince men that they are
inadequate, inept, and undesirable.
 I realize that some women may retort with a
resounding, “Yes, it is about time.” However ladies,
please consider the potential damage to men’s self-
43
images that may cause further set-backs in our
relationships, ultimately affecting our sexual
experiences.
 At some point (pardon the pun), I would love to
see us simply accept our bodies as the beautiful
creations that they are without the attached
criticism, evaluation, and degradation from the
media.
 Before we go into Part Two of the book that
addresses sexual technique, perhaps it would be a
good idea to take a moment and make a sexual
philosophy list. Write down all of your beliefs,
feelings, and attitudes regarding your body and
anything of a sexual nature. Study the list. Ask
yourself if those beliefs exist because they are truly
your own, or because someone or something in your
life has placed them there. Ask yourself important
questions, such as, “Is sex dirty because I think it
is, or because my family or friends have told me it
is?” Quiz yourself as to your own level of selfesteem. Ask yourself, “Are my thighs or beer belly
really something to cause me shame or am I just
believing the lie of the myth that says I should look
like the models in magazines?” Finally, examine
your feelings about your genitals. Answer the
SO WHAT WENT WRONG?
44
SEX TALKS
question, “What is the worst thing that would
happen if I touched myself?”
 After writing your list and asking some very
pertinent questions, cross off your list everything
that you wish to eliminate. Then replace your list
with a different mindset. For example, if your list
has “Oral sex is dirty” and you realize that you
don’t really believe this, then cross it out and write,
“Oral sex is a normal and healthy sexual act.” You
may even wish to include an affirmation like, “I
engage and enjoy giving and receiving oral sex.”
Be patient with yourself. It may take some time to
change old thought patterns into new ones. But
don’t give up because I guarantee it can be done!
45
PART TWO

SEX TALKS
CHAPTER FOUR
“LOOK JOEY,
FOREPLAY!”
How do we create loving relationships that last?
What steps can we take to ensure that our
relationship does not end up in the fifty percent
category called “divorce?” There are many ways to
keep the flames ignited and our souls united. One
way is by giving what is often referred to as “gifts
of love.” These can be as simple as kind words given
in the form of compliments, or by sending flowers
to your beloved. We can cook dinner while adding
candles and soft, romantic music to the dining
experience. We can give cards and small gifts.
There are hundreds of things we can do to show
our partners how very much we love and appreciate
them. And I call these things, expressions of
foreplay.
 Foreplay! The excitement phase of sex that
raises our heart rate, respiratory rate, and prepares
our minds and bodies for sex. Foreplay! The thing
47
that makes many women say, “Ah yes!” and a few
men say, “Oh, no!” Yet, it is a vital part of the sexual
experience and will enhance intimacy, increase the
likelihood of orgasm, and will help to keep you
connected to your beloved throughout time and
space.
 So what is foreplay? To give examples I am going
to use what I call the alphabet soup of sex—or
foreplay soup. It may seem rudimentary, but
believe me it is not—the A through Z of foreplay is
the most important part of sex. Foreplay is the sex
before the sex and it begins with A…
 “A” stands for “Affection.” Affection covers a lot
of territory, but think of it as an act of kindness.
Words of love spoken softly in your lover’s ear, a
suggestive glance, or a gentle touch. One of the best
examples of affection was from years ago while
attending a social function with my now exhusband and our best friends, Joey and Alma. We
had just picked them up at their house and they
were riding in the back seat of our car. I turned
around to face them to talk to them, and noticed
that Joey had taken Alma’s hand in his. As soon as
he did this, Alma responded with “Look Joey,
foreplay!”
“LOOK JOEY, FOREPLAY!”

 The significance of this has stayed with me for
many years as I realize the vital importance of this
act of affection. So perhaps as a precursor to sex,
affection is where it all begins—affection, attention,
and appreciation. All of these things are displays
of love that help bond, connect, and create solid,
loving relationships—with great sex as the bonus!
 Next comes “B” and I will use the word “Body”
because of course without our bodies, there can be
no sex! (No kidding, Sherlock!) One of the
interesting things about the U, is what I hear
couples say regarding grooming habits after the
three-month mark. Up to this point, it appears that
each partner will go to great lengths to shower,
shave, and primp to make themselves attractive
and sexy to their partner.
 For some reason, much of this diminishes after
three months. Where once there was cologne or
perfume, suddenly there is none; dress clothes are
replaced with sloppy sweatshirts and jeans; and,
many of the grooming strategies designed to lure
one’s beloved into our grasp, diminish or vanish
altogether. Even manners may be forgotten.
 Now, I am not saying that these are bad things.
Much of this is finding a comfort zone with one’s
49
partner. What I am saying is that changes may
occur that could bring one partner or the other
reasons to feel that the excitement and newness of
the relationship is gone.
 Remember, physical attraction is what brought
us together in that “top of the U” moment. One
way to keep the passion ignited may be in the
continuance of personal grooming habits, that keep
us being perceived as “new” and “exciting” by our
partners.
 My professor of “Marriage and Family” class at
San Jose State University, told me something I will
never forget. When I asked him to tell me in very
simple terms what he believed were the reasons
for a successful marriage, his answer to me was
one word—courtship. So, “C” will stand for
“Courtship.”
 With relationships moving at superspeeds, I am
afraid that courtship, in many respects, may be a
thing of the past. Yet, its application is definitely a
form of foreplay and when in place, provides both
partners with the feelings that they are loved and
appreciated.
 So what do I mean by “Courtship?” Everyday,
try to think of something you can do to help your
“LOOK JOEY, FOREPLAY!”
50
SEX TALKS
partner know how much you love him or her. Put
notes on cars, in lunches, purses, or wallets, send
flowers or just place a single flower in a surprise
location. Leave phone messages—even seductive
ones. Purchase your partner’s favorite candy bar
or make her favorite meal.
Rub his feet, back or shoulders. Tell her
something about her that you find particularly
endearing, and if you run out of ideas, buy books
which offer hundreds and even thousands of ways
to tell your partner you love him or her.
 Make a commitment to court your lover. Saying
“I love you” is important, but perhaps it is true
that “Actions speak louder than words.”
 I did not use the word “Commitment” for the
“C” not because I don’t think it is of vital
importance, but because I think the word
“Devotion” will be used for “D” because it takes
commitment to a deeper level. Being devoted means
just that—deeply committed to our partner and to
the relationship. You know, the way we feel in the
first three months. We can think of nothing or no
other than our beloved. Our focus is on her and we
devote ourselves totally to him.
51
 “Excitement” is the “E” in our foreplay soup. This
is one of those words, as are many, which is
subjectively defined. What excites you may not
excite me and vice versa. However, to illustrate the
kind of romantic excitement that is found between
couples, I will share with you the following story.
 I was working as a case worker for Big Brothers
and Big Sisters of America. My supervisor (the
Director) and I were addressing a large group of
potential big sisters in a local school gymnasium.
There was a door to the north of the gym and we
were located at the south end. While the Director
was speaking, the north door opened and in walked
a man, seemingly miles away and in a moment that
appeared frozen in time.
 I observed my Director as she turned to look at
the man, her face becoming quite red. (I later
learned that this is called “sex flush”.) It was
obvious that her breathing had changed and the
room was so quiet one could hear a pin drop. The
man continued to walk toward the Director and
then gently kissed her on the cheek. As he stood
beside her with a huge smile on his face, she turned
to face her audience and said, “I am sorry for the
interruption. This is my husband and although I
“LOOK JOEY, FOREPLAY!”
52
SEX TALKS
have been married to him for almost twenty years,
every time he walks into a room, my heart still
skips a beat.” It was obvious that her heart was
doing a great deal of skipping. At that moment, I
realized that what they shared was something I
wanted—needed and deeply desired.
 When applying the word excitement to sex, it
might be helpful to understand what happens
physiologically when one is sexually aroused.
Vaginal lubrication is the result for women usually
within ten to thirty seconds of becoming excited.
The clitoris will grow and swell and the uterus will
become elevated. For a man, the penis fills with
blood, the testicles enlarge, and elevate. Also, with
both genders, the nipples will become erect. Thus,
we understand how important excitement is—it IS
foreplay and a necessary part of sex!
 My good friend Samantha once told me that if
you don’t ask for what you want, how can you expect
to get it? Duh! Sexual fantasies (the “F”) are normal
and natural. If you have a “Fantasy” that you wish
to experience, tell your partner. If you’ve been
talking about sex from the beginning, then it can
be used as a way for a couple to further explore
and discover ways to sexually pleasure each other.
53
A word of caution may be appropriate here. If your
partner shares her deepest, darkest, and most
secret sexual fantasies with you and you act
shocked by what she reveals to you, you many never
again find her sharing her fantasies with you. Selfdisclosure on this kind of personal level requires
faith and trust that your secrets will not be judged
or labeled as weird, disgusting, funny, or just plain
gross.
 Acceptance will form a bond of trust providing
opportunities for further and future intimacies to
occur. Furthermore, if you find that the fantasies
of your partner are not ones you feel comfortable
fulfilling, then it is important to simply tell this to
your partner. Ideally, the acceptance will be
reciprocated.
 The next letters in our sex alphabet are really
more about the art of being present in our
relationships, and are building blocks to great sex!
Having an attitude of “Gratitude” (“G”) with a sense
of “Honor” (“H”) helps to develop mutual respect
between partners. I have often heard it said that
family members are kinder to strangers than they
are to each other. Sadly enough, to some extent I
think this is true. How many times do we thank
“LOOK JOEY, FOREPLAY!”
54
SEX TALKS
our partners for the things (both large and small)
that they do for us in our lives? Do we say “Thank
you” after sex or do we just assume it is our
partner’s responsibility to provide it to us? Having
an attitude of gratitude will help keep each partner
feeling appreciated and respected.
 Speaking of respect, in a way that I chose
devotion over commitment, I also would chose the
word “honor” over respect. Honor is acceptance in
the highest sense of the word. For example, if one
partner is tired or simply does not feel like engaging
in sexual activity, the other has a choice to honor
that decision. Often I hear men and women say
that when they refuse the sexual advances of their
partner, they often find behavior reflecting anger,
frustration, and even pouting. Here is where
masturbation and self-pleasuring is most useful.
Each partner honors the other’s choice, and still
meets their individual needs. But that is the “M”
and we are only at the “I.”
 For the “I” my choice is “Intimacy.” As previously
mentioned, many people believe that intimacy
means sex. The truth is that although sex may be
associated with intimacy, it is not synonymous with
sex. Intimacy is in a sense, exposure, vulnerability,
55
and openness. It is the bearing of one’s soul to
another. It is the act of self-disclosure telling
another of our deepest, darkest fears. Intimacy is
a connection between two people that creates an
environment for trust and respect. Intimacy is also
a precursor for Sacred Sex, which I describe in
detail in Chapters Seven and Eight.
 I believe that one of the best books ever written
about sexual positions is The Joy of Sex. Therefore,
I do not feel a need to reiterate the myriad of
positions already presented and illustrated in this
grand text. However, there is one position that I
will mention here and then again in Chapter Eight.
Not necessarily a sexual position, the spoon position
places each partner in juxtaposition to each other.
“Juxtaposition” means side-by-side, and of course
gives us our “J” in our continuation of the foreplay
soup.
 Spooning, (also known as “nurturing meditation”
in Chapter Eight and illustrated on page entitled
“Part Three”) can be used whether one is naked or
fully clothed. It is best used as energy transference
to a partner who may be unusually tired or void of
energy.
“LOOK JOEY, FOREPLAY!”
56
SEX TALKS
The partner with the most energy will lie behind
the one needing energy. With both partners lying
on their sides, the person behind will concentrate
on giving his partner energy that flows from the
front of his body into the back of his partner’s body.
This position is very effective and can be used to
restore one’s energy prior to sex, or simply as a
recharging technique.
 Some say that there is nothing quite like a first
“Kiss.” I disagree. I think that every kiss (“K”) is
the sweetest kiss. There are so many ways to use
one’s lips and mouth. Even though kissing is very
personal, I will offer several kissing techniques in
Chapter Eight. I highly suggest that each partner
discuss his or her likes and dislikes in this arena.
And then… kiss often!
 For the letter “L” I think it may be important to
use two words—“Love” and “Lust.” Many believe
that these words are dichotomous. I believe that
they are very much integrated and
interchangeable. The word “Lust,” means to possess
an intense sexual desire.
Well, isn’t this what we would all wish to obtain
and maintain within the context of our love
relationship? The fact is that couples claiming to
57
have a great relationship will almost always say
that this is an element still present between them.
Remember that those feelings of “lust” are what
brought you together in the first place. So why
wouldn’t we still want to experience those same
feelings throughout the duration of our
relationship?
 Okay, now we can discuss the “M” which stands
for “Masturbation.” Some of you are cringing at the
thought of this word, and yet it is so very necessary
in our development and creation of fulfilling sex.
The word means self-pleasuring. It means knowing
what makes us feel good so that we can adequately
tell and show our partners. There will be more
about masturbation in the next chapter.
 For the “N” I like the words “Natural” and
“Now.” “Natural,” because I truly believe that we
are all sexual beings and have a profound desire to
do what comes naturally to us. However, because
of our thoughts about certain sexual issues we may
hold back from, or alter the natural flow of sexual
activity. Still, there is no time like the present to
enjoy sex, so here’s my advice—Do what feels
natural and do it NOW! (At least as long as it
doesn’t hurt anyone and isn’t against the law.)
“LOOK JOEY, FOREPLAY!”
58
SEX TALKS
 I bet you thought I would use the word orgasm
for the “O” didn’t you? Nope—this is foreplay stuff
and the big O has to wait for the next chapter. So
“O” will stand for “Oblige.” I use this word because
sexual compatibility and sexual satisfaction are
largely based on the ability of each partner to meet
the needs of the other—in other words, to oblige
his or her partner. I am not suggesting that one
engage in sexual activity as an obligation. Rather,
I believe that sexual satisfaction is reached when
each partner happily, willingly, and completely
obliges each other by meeting each other’s sexual
needs, desires, and wishes. Perhaps the next time
your partner asks for a certain sexual act, your
response could be “Happy to oblige you, Dear!”
 Passion. Ah, the “P” in the pulse of life. That
feeling which drives us to unbelievable heights and
gut-wrenching depths. Once experienced, it
becomes the life force that propels us—the very
thing we feel we can not live without! When passion
wraps around us we cling tightly, knowing that
living is lifeless without its presence. My wish for
all of you is that your relationships are continually
passionate. Thus passion brings us to the “Q.”
59
 The “Q” in our foreplay soup is “Quintessential”
which means pure and perfect. May you have
purely, perfectly, passionate sex!
 But first dear friends, may you have the “R”
which stands for the “Romance” of all romances.
May you rewrite and relive the story of Romeo and
Juliet. May you find yourselves surrounded with
flowers, cards, and notes expressing undying love
and devotion every day of your lives. May the
romance that first brought you and your partner
together continue to grow and expand, and may
you both commit to the notion of romance as a
symbol of your love and as an expression of the
passion that exists between you.
 Similar to the words “lust” and “love,” you may
not think that “Self-esteem” and “Sensuality” are
interconnected. Trust me—they are! Women who
feel good about themselves, are often described by
others as sensuous. Many men say that there is
nothing sexier than a woman who feels good about
her body and is unafraid to use her body
sensuously, regardless of her size and shape. This
may include things like wearing sexy lingerie,
dancing sensuously for her lover, or simply walking
or standing naked.
“LOOK JOEY, FOREPLAY!”
60
SEX TALKS
 Having a strong sense of self directly ties back
into intimacy as we are able to stand, both
emotionally exposed and physically naked, for our
partners; unashamed and secure of who we are and
how we look. For the “S” then, you choose the word!
 Of course, to engage in the aforementioned
behavior, trust must be established. The word
“Trust” (“T”) means many things to many people,
but in the context of this book, I intend for it to
encompass the act of speaking and acting
consciously and with a certain level of sensitivity.
I have discovered that relationships are more often
than not, very fragile things. Very often they hang
by threads rather than by rope. Issues of trust can
either add to the tread or shred it toward a state of
collapse.
 Speaking and acting consciously and with
sensitivity simply means that we carefully consider
the consequences of our words and actions. For
example, if your partner musters up the courage
to perform a seductive dance for you, slowly
disrobing, and you happen to laugh or say
something insensitive, then a part of him or her
may retreat and close off forever. Sometimes things
said in jest, may do more damage than we realize.
61
Without consciously meaning to, trust may be
betrayed, feelings may be hurt, and the damage
repair may take years. It has been said that it
only takes a second to do something we may
regret for a lifetime.
 For the “U” I like the word “Unity,” which means
wholeness, oneness, and harmony. This is the
goal—the ultimate outcome I believe we strive for
in our relationships. This is the connection we
crave; the destination along the proverbial U as
we navigate from top left downward, and then
upward again toward top right.
 Each person entering into a relationship knows
on some level, what is and what isn’t essential to
him or her—essential meaning what he or she can
or can not do without. Although compromise is a
vital component to the success of any relationship,
giving up those things held vital to one’s well being,
may eventually cause anger and resentment. Thus,
when describing the meaning of the “V” my
suggestion here is to give “Voice” to what is “Vital”
to you, or you may lose the “Vitality” in your
relationship.
 Two words will be used for the “W.” Words that
are prerequisites for the giver and the receiver
“LOOK JOEY, FOREPLAY!”
62
SEX TALKS
regarding sexual pleasuring. When engaging in
sexual activity, it may work best when the giver
has the “Will” to please and when the receiver feels
a sense of “Worthiness” to receive. Both attitudes
seem to work best when the partners are in a state
of balance, helping to create equality when giving
and receiving. When one partner is continually the
giver and one is the receiver, the couple is out of
sync and may possibly create patterns of imbalance
that may affect the joy, happiness, and satisfaction
of the couple.
 The optimum in this situation is for both
partners to be one hundred percent willing to give
to the other, while believing themselves to be one
hundred percent worthy to receive.
 “X?” X-rated. Much of what you are about to read
in the following chapter may be considered to be
X-rated. Reader advised.
 Yes, yes, yes! What better word could we find in
our alphabet soup than “YES!” for our “Y. Say “yes”
to love, to laughter, to joy, to sex, and most
definitely to life!
 So at long last we come to the end of our foreplay
soup. Can you think of more appropriate words to
describe foreplay than the words, “Zest” and “Zeal?”
63
I can’t either, which is why we will use them for
our “Z.” Showing continual enthusiasm and
excitement toward our partners will help to keep
them coming back for more, time and time again.
Showing zealousness for our partners and for their
bodies is like opening gifts on Christmas day. There
is an air of excitement, a feeling of anticipation,
and a rush of adrenaline as we see the gift unwrap
before our very eyes.

CHAPTER FIVE
“PLEASE ME,
PLEASE!”
As far as I am concerned, one of the biggest
travesties of our culture is the lack of information
available regarding sexual technique. Over the
years I have read, researched, and studied much
about sexual technique and wish to share it with
you now. I feel that I have compiled enough
information over the years to warrant giving
suggestions regarding sexual pleasuring.
 Technique is based on personal and individual
likes and dislikes and because of this, sexual
techniques will be presented in a general sense.
The best suggestion regarding technique, is always
communication. Our ability to tell our partners
what we want regarding sexual pleasuring is really
the best advice.
 Much of the information presented applies to
techniques enjoyed by both genders. However, for
ease of reading and understanding, I will divide
65
this chapter into three parts—“His,” “Hers,” and
“His and Hers.” And of course…ladies first!
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
66

HERS
At this point, an assumption is going to be made
that the foreplay soup has been brewing all day.
With a sense of readiness and anticipation, we
begin to travel the pathway leading us toward the
sexual release we call “orgasm.” The journey has
found us naked, with our partner, and in a room
filled with soft music and dim lighting. Candles
offer a wonderful source of light, while also adding
aromatherapy for our sexual senses. Lavender and
jasmine scents are particularly pleasing. Our
bodies are bathed and cleaned and the use of body
oils, colognes or perfumes are optional.
 Throughout this journey toward orgasm, it is
important to remember to kiss each other often.
Also, when face-to-face, eye contact is an important
way to stay present with each other. Now
gentlemen, with an attitude of avoidance, avoid the
breasts and the genitals. After much kissing, ask
your beloved to lie on her stomach and let the
journey begin…
 Begin by rubbing her back and shoulders with
or without oil. As you begin the massage, your
hands will move down each arm and then return
again to the shoulders and back. Take one arm and
67
thoroughly massage it while kissing, licking, and
sucking various parts of the arm.
 Take her hand and massage the palm and each
finger. Take each finger and place it inside your
mouth sucking as you reach the fingertip. Move
your tongue between the fingers and as you place
her fingers in your mouth allow your bottom teeth
to gently slide along the underside of each finger.
 Continue massaging the arm as you kiss and
lick the inside elbow and the underside of the arm.
Sucking and nibbling are also stimulating.
Continue this method with both arms, returning
to the back and shoulders.
 After each arm has been massaged, kissed, and
nibbled, begin to kiss the back of the neck lightly.
When you arrive at the ear, suck the edge of the
ear, and very gently place your tongue inside each
ear. This may be accompanied with a soft blowing
inside the ear. Continue kissing the neck and then
drag your tongue down her spine kissing, sucking,
and nibbling while you move back upward toward
the neck. Kiss the back while you continue rubbing,
being careful not to move to the rib area where she
may be ticklish.
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
68
SEX TALKS
 Rub the lower back and avoid the buttocks at
this time. Move down toward her thighs and
continue massaging while running your tongue
down her leg toward her ankle. Sucking the back
of the knee is particularly pleasing and the inner
thigh is an area of great sensitivity. Make sure to
address both legs equally.
 As you continue rubbing, begin to massage her
buttocks, being careful not to pull the buttocks
apart at the rectum as it produces a painful
sensation. Kissing, sucking, licking, and nibbling
on the buttocks are suggested and by this time,
you may begin to notice her thrusting her hips. If
you feel tempted to penetrate at this point—don’t,
as you are only about one-third of the way through
your journey.
 Run your fingers lightly up and down the crevice
of the buttocks and the use of your tongue is
suggested. If you feel comfortable at this point,
gently spread the buttocks and very lightly lick the
anus. This is called “rimming,” and it can often lead
to orgasm. Gently kissing and sucking on the anus
brings a unique sensation and is very much a
personal preference.
69
 If at this point she is nearing orgasm, stop the
rimming activity and gently roll her over onto her
back. Reestablish eye contact and kissing while
avoiding the breasts and genitals. Once again,
massage the arms while kissing, sucking, and
nibbling the area on the underside of the arm.
Revisit the fingers if you like. After each arm has
been massaged and kissed, return to the neck and
face. Lightly kiss the forehead, each of the eye lids,
the nose, the cheeks, and the ears. Don’t forget the
lips!
 Speaking of the kiss, taking each lip and gently
sucking it produces a pleasing sensation. Also,
pleasant is running the tongue along the gum lines.
Sucking the tongue gives the image and feel similar
to that of the clitoris and can be sexually exciting.
Moving from the neck area, run the fingers and
the tongue down the front of the chest to the navel.
Still avoiding the genitals, kiss the stomach lightly
while massaging the hips. Begin massaging the legs
with the inclusion of kissing, sucking, and nibbling.
Massaging the knees brings a feeling of relaxation
so don’t forget them. As you make your way toward
the feet, continue touching the legs and then taking
one foot at a time, massage the bottoms and the
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
70
SEX TALKS
heel. Then rub one toe at a time. Similar to the
technique used on the fingers, take one toe at a
time and gently suck it, moving your head up and
down on each toe. As you do this, remember to use
your bottom teeth to lightly slide across the
underside of each toe.
 If she hasn’t been begging you to penetrate by
this time, she will now. As you leave the feet and
move your hands in an upward motion along the
inside of her thighs, allow your thumbs to gently
touch each side of her genitals, known as the Labia
Majora (the outer lips). Begin to massage the Mons
Pubis (or the hairy fatty pad as one of my male
students called it), producing a sensation similar
to that of men when the scrotum is touched. Gently
kiss the Mons Pubis area while continuing to rub
each thumb along the outer lips.
 By this time her readiness should be apparent
by the amount of wetness you feel. If oral sex is an
option for both of you, at this point you may decide
to tease and tantalize. Very gently part the lips
and softly run your tongue up and down each Labia
Minora (inner lips) but avoid the clitoris.
 It is now suggested that you attend to her
breasts, alternating between the genitals and the
71
breasts. Taking her breasts in both hands, gently
(emphasis here on “gently”), massage them. Many
women enjoy a light sucking and gentle licking,
while others enjoy a firm touch and a strong
sucking of the nipples. However, sucking her
breasts too hard can be painful and will reduce the
level of excitement you have been attempting to
create. So simply ask what she likes! Also, the
entire area of the breast is sensitive to touch, so
don’t miss any of it when kissing and fondling them.
 Moving from her genitals to her breasts and then
to the lips is psychologically bonding to a couple
because it shows a total acceptance by both
partners of body fluids and scents. As you move
from lips to breasts back to the genitals, keep in
mind that by this time the clitoris is engorging with
blood and may be extremely sensitive to touch. As
you move your tongue along the inner and outer
lips, bring your tongue to the clitoris very gently.
It is very important here to know that when using
the tongue on the clitoris, only a circular or sideto-side motion is best. Up and down strokes can be
very painful and almost abrasive in feeling.
 After several strokes on the clitoris with the
tongue, the level of sensitivity may be reduced. At
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
72
SEX TALKS
this point you may wish to bring your partner to
orgasm or engage in sexual intercourse. As a side
note—if using the fingers instead of the mouth, or
in conjunction with the mouth, the same motions
apply—circular or side-to-side movements.
 If your partner wishes you to bring her to orgasm
orally, then it is very important that you apply
steady and consistent pressure. Begin moving the
tongue on the clitoris very slowly at first, increasing
your speed as she nears orgasm. The motion is
really a side-to-side flicking of the tongue rather
than a massaging motion. While stimulating the
clitoris you may also wish to continue the gentle
stroking on the vaginal lips while occasionally
inserting your finger or tongue inside the vagina.
 If you desire to help your partner achieve both a
clitoral and a vaginal orgasm, then I suggest you
become familiar with the Grafenberg Spot
(commonly known as the “G” spot). There is
variation and even controversy as to the exact
location of the G spot, whether or not it even exists,
and if there is such a thing as a “vaginal orgasm”
as a result of stimulating the G spot. I happen to
believe that the G spot does exist, and vaginal
orgasms are definitely real!
73
 The G spot can generally be found between the
cervix and the pubic bone. However, a number of
women tell me that theirs is located just inside the
vaginal canal. One method of discovery is to place
the lower two-thirds of your middle finger along
the vaginal opening and the outer labia. Gently
enter the inner lip region and curl the middle
fingertip in toward the vaginal opening. The skin
located around the G spot has a rather rough feel
to it and can be identified by this roughness.
 Okay, so once you locate the G spot you may
move your finger back and forth while penetrating
the vagina and stimulating the G spot. A technique
used to stroke the G spot may be to stroke it as you
would if you were gesturing “come here.” Don’t
forget about what your tongue and mouth are
doing—circular or side-to-side motions on the
clitoris. Use firm pressure and increase the speed
as she nears orgasm.
 Don’t worry if you find this technique difficult
at first. Remember that practice makes perfect.
Now, if you choose oral sex as a form of foreplay
rather than as a means to reach orgasm, then at
this point you may wish to stop so that you can
begin penetration.
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
74
SEX TALKS
 Your partner’s level of arousal should be
apparent and you are probably well aware of her
level of lubrication. However, prior to intercourse
and as a general rule, always insert a finger inside
the vagina to check for adequate lubrication. A good
way to shut down her sexual excitement is to
penetrate without her being totally lubricated.
 You may notice that she is about to explode from
the wonderful techniques you have been using. You
may be so ready yourself that the temptation to
thrust your penis inside of her vagina and move
full speed ahead is present. Don’t! Tease her and
tantalize her a bit more with further stimulation
of the G spot. This technique is very simple. Place
the head of your penis just inside the vagina, and
then pullout. It will feel like a pop and what you
are actually doing is massaging her G spot. This
motion can be repeated and alternated with deep
thrusting motions.
 The position you choose is unimportant here as
this technique works well in any position. If using
the “pop” technique, she may wish to manually
stimulate her clitoris in an effort to achieve both a
clitoral and a vaginal orgasm. If a clitoral orgasm
is desired through penetration, then you may need
75
to bring your body up onto hers so that her pubic
area and the base of your penis are in contact with
the clitoris. Again, use slow motions initially and
then increase the speed as you both near orgasm.
 Although not a regular form of penetration, anal
sex offers unique sensations and can add to the
variety of sexual activity. The only suggestion I
have is to make sure that anal sex is done with
safety and cleanliness in mind. Some form of
lubricant is a must and slow entry is advised.
 Speaking of lubricants—K-Y Jelly is the choice
over Vaseline or other lubricants, as it washes away
much easier than Vaseline.

Not as a criticism to women, but as an observation
of fact, men are sexually simplistic. Generally
speaking, they may require more frequent sexual
activity than women, but their readiness time is
much less. However, please note that I say
“generally speaking” in an effort not to be
stereotyping male behavior. Much of the
information I receive is from the young males in
my classes and therefore, any variation may be
based on any number of factors; one being age.
Other factors may include one’s general health, the
presence of alcohol or drugs that may affect sexual
readiness and levels of excitement, and the amount
of intimacy shared between a man and his partner.
 Many men confess that the intensity of their
orgasms does seem to be based on their level of
excitement, and foreplay is a vital part of this
excitement.
 One of the sexual differences I have discovered
between the genders is that of touch. Women seem
to prefer a softer touch, while men seem to enjoy a
firmer touch. Many men have stated that they do
not enjoy a light, almost ticklish touch, while many
77
women find it sexually arousing. Again, it is a
matter of preference.
 Also, men tend to want to “go straight for the
cookie jar” while women tend to want to “savor the
moment.” So while keeping all these things in mind,
we will now begin our sexual journey toward the
destination of the male orgasm.
 My male friends tell me their biggest turn-on is
sexual arousal. When I asked them to explain, they
responded by telling me that this includes
everything visual and auditory. Visual, from the
standpoint of seeing your naked body; auditory
because they want you to talk to them. Believe it
or not, one of the biggest arousal techniques is your
own display of desire for him. This can be shown
through your willingness to be open to his desires.
 Many of the techniques described for women,
are also ones that many men enjoy. However, I will
not reiterate those methods here, and will only
describe the variations that I believe exist. Keep
in mind that both genders may enjoy the variation,
as well as, the inclusion of all the techniques.
 Okay ladies, let us assume that your man is
always ready for sex. Now there may be times this
is not true, like during an illness or in times of
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
78
SEX TALKS
stress or depression. Generally speaking, many
men only need to be given a sign of encouragement
and they are good to go.
 But we want to savor the moment, so we
tantalize and tease until they feel they will explode.
So as we begin to travel the male body, our
participation and excitement will also add to theirs.
(Guys, the reverse is also true!)
 As you begin to massage, kiss, suck, and nibble
on your partner’s body, build the anticipation by
telling him exactly what you wish to do to him. I
suggest beginning with a back massage and
employing many of the kissing and nibbling
techniques previously described. A man may wish
a bite, as opposed to a nibble (no drawing blood,
ladies) and remember to use a firm touch when
massaging his body.
 When kissing, suck his tongue while moving
your own tongue around his. Build his excitement
by telling him that you will be doing the same thing
with his penis later on. Although a man’s chest and
stomach area may be sensitive to touch, his breasts
and nipples are still areas that provide sexual
stimulation.
79
 A man’s buttocks are normally very muscular
and a firm massage may be desired. Rimming is
suggested and again, this is a sexual activity
requiring safety and cleanliness. Because a man’s
G spot is located in his rectum, you may wish to
place a finger inside the rectum, stimulating the G
spot. A lubricant may be useful. Upon insertion, I
suggest you move slowly, only inserting further as
you feel the rectal muscles loosen. A caveat here is
to beware of long fingernails!
 Address the feet, legs, arms and hands to the
extent he desires and most definitely, tell him what
you wish to do. As you turn him on his back, look
deeply into his eyes and show your pleasure at the
sight of what by now is most likely a very erect
penis.
 If you are not naked, begin to take off your
clothes—slowly, deliberately, unashamedly, one
piece at a time. Show him your anticipation for the
fullness of him. Continue talking, but avoid
touching his scrotum and penis. Kiss his neck,
chest, and inner thighs. Go back to his mouth and
kiss him with deep, passionate kisses.
 If you are comfortable, touch your breasts and
genitals. Many men confess intense levels of
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
80
SEX TALKS
excitement at the sight of their partner touching
herself. Continue massaging the front of his body
and position yourself between his legs to rub the
thighs and knees. Gently bring the hands upward,
stroking the testicles in the process. Move your
hand between his legs and with your fingers, trace
the perineum (the area between the anus and
scrotum) in upward strokes. Allow your hands to
now lightly touch the penis. Alternate your hands
so that one is on the scrotum moving upward and
the other is moving up the penis.
 Talk. Kiss. Touch him and yourself if you are
comfortable doing so. Now, if acceptable to both of
you, lower your head and gently take his penis into
your mouth. Allow the saliva to form, providing
lubrication for sucking. By the way the term “blow
job” is erroneous as the word “fellatio” (oral sex
performed on a man) means “to suck,” in Latin.
 Okay, now remember, you have two hands and
a mouth, so be sure to use them. One hand
continues fondling the testicles, even lightly
squeezing them. Use whichever hand feels most
comfortable. Using either hand, alternate between
touching the scrotum and the testicles, while
81
tracing the line along the perineum. Insert a finger
into the rectum if desired.
 While one hand is touching the scrotum, the
other is rubbing the base of the penis and the penis.
This hand can even rub the area directly above the
penis, below the belly button, alternating back
toward the base and the shaft of the penis. Both
hands are in motion during oral sex.
 As your hands are moving so is your mouth, and
of course, so is your tongue. As you take the penis
deeply into your mouth, rub the tongue over the
area called the frenulum. The frenulum is the fold
of skin around the base of the head and is
particularly sensitive to touch. Try flicking motions
and firm pressure with your tongue, on this area.
 The head of a man’s penis, particularly around
the point where the shaft meets the head, is the
most sensitive. So, remember the “pop” where the
head of the penis barely enters the vagina and then
“pops” out? Well, place the head of the penis into
your mouth and then pop it out. Watch your teeth!
Alternate this activity between deep strokes and
pops. Keep the hands moving and oh yes—make
noises. Make sounds of pleasure and excitement
so that he feels you are doing what you really want
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
82
SEX TALKS
to do, and not because you feel you have to. In
addition, as you make noises, he will feel a vibration
on his penis and this will further add stimulation.
 This next motion will probably result in orgasm,
so a word of caution here if this is not what you
both want at this time. While taking the penis into
one of your hands, synchronize your mouth and
hand so that they are moving up and down the
penis from top to bottom. Pay particularly close
attention to the head, making sure your hand and
mouth come all the way to the top of the penis.
 A normal stroke is up and down in a continual
motion. However, as you come up the penis, turn
the hand in a clockwise position and when moving
back down, turn it counter clockwise. Move your
mouth in the same manner, remembering the value
of the pressure of the tongue and hand on the
frenulum. Don’t get discouraged if this takes some
time to master. Remember—“Practice makes
perfect.”
 Once again you may find that you both wish to
end this journey through the release of orgasm. I
am fairly sure what my next suggestion will bring
from many of my women readers. Yes, ladies, I am
strongly suggesting you swallow. Furthermore, not
83
just swallow, but lick every bit of semen from your
partner’s body. Do it as if you are sweetly savoring
every drop and continue the act with passion and
excitement. Men will tell you that the level of
acceptance and love they feel from this experience
is among the greatest they have ever had. Yet, few
say they have ever had it and many speak of their
desire to do so.
 If you experience a gagging sensation
throughout any part of oral sex, a technique you
may find helpful is to simply breathe. Take deep
breaths through your nose and allow the throat
muscles to relax.
 When orgasm is not realized through means of
oral sex, then at this point you may wish to engage
in intercourse. If your partner does not check you
for adequate lubrication, then make sure you check
yourself to avoid any pain or injury.
 At this point, the position used is simply a matter
of preference. (Again, I refer you to The Joy of Sex
for a multitude of descriptive sexual positions.)
What remains to be most important is the
continuation of desire, passion, and willingness.
And of course, sex talk. Move your body in unison
with his and remember that regardless of the myths
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
84
SEX TALKS
we have been told, most men do want their partners
to experience pleasure. If you show you are
sincerely being pleasured, his experience will be
greatly enhanced. The reverse also holds true.
85
HIS AND HERS
One method that is often overlooked or downplayed
is that of masturbation. Again, I am surprised how
infrequently it is discussed, as it is very often the
only way some women reach orgasm.
 Masturbation may include self-pleasuring and
partner pleasuring. I have spoken with men who
claim that watching a woman during the act of selfpleasuring is extremely exciting and arousing to
them. Yet, it seems that this is one of those issues
that some women find embarrassing and shameful.
Therefore, if women find their bodies to be
disgusting or dirty, then touching themselves in
private, much less in front of their partner, would
be unthinkable. Perhaps a change in mindset would
assist with any sexual healing in this area. (I
suggest my first book Doc Talks as a reference and
aid for methods in changing one’s mindset.)
 When orgasm is not achieved or simply as a form
of foreplay, masturbation offers one more way of
touching for sexual arousal. If both of you are
touching your own bodies, then of course only you
know best what gives you pleasure. If you are
touching each other, then I will give some
suggestions for further pleasuring.
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
86
SEX TALKS
 When masturbating a woman, much of what was
said regarding oral sex applies. Remember that the
clitoris is highly sensitive and for optimal
pleasuring, slow, circular or side-to-side motions
work best. (For further proof, rent a pornographic
video and watch the finger motion of the females
as they masturbate themselves.)
 There are many ways to touch the clitoris and
stimulate the G spot at the same time. Again,
remember that you have two hands and one mouth
and you can use them creatively. One hand and
finger can be stimulating the clitoris while the other
hand and finger can stimulate the G spot. The
mouth can be kissing, sucking, and licking various
parts of the body. Remember eye contact and
kissing!
 A woman can be on her back or on her stomach.
If on her stomach, it may be necessary for you to
be on your knees with your hand placed flush
against her buttocks, reaching the middle finger
forward resting lightly on her clitoris. You may
wish to alternate between her vagina and the G
spot, and her clitoris.
 As you begin the slow circular motions, increase
the speed and pressure as you begin to feel her
87
arousal heighten. The best way to bring a woman
to orgasm through masturbation is by using an
evenly consistent motion.
 Believe it or not, some men are equally as
embarrassed and ashamed to masturbate in front
of their partner, as are some women. However, if
you have a partner who is encouraging you to touch
yourself and is willing to watch you masturbate, it
is extremely helpful. It allows you to see the
touching technique that works best for him or her.
However, if this is not possible, then my advice for
masturbating a man would be very similar to what
I described in the oral sex portion of this chapter.
 Men say that a long firm stroke is most desirable.
Again, it bears repeating that you have two hands
and a mouth, so make sure to use them. One hand
may be fondling the testicles, while the other is
stroking the penis. Use whatever hand is most
comfortable for holding the penis. Begin at the base
and with a firm grip bring your hand upward to
the head making sure to apply extra firmness
around the area of the head and frenulum. You
many even wish to position your hand in a way
that allows the fingers to stroke the frenulum.
When the hand is toward the tip of the penis, turn
“PLEASE ME, PLEASE!”
88
SEX TALKS
it half an inch or so, clockwise or counter clockwise,
and move back down to the base of the penis.
Repeat this pattern. You may wish to use an oil or
lubricant.
 The consistency and firmness of the strokes are
important. Also, as he is sexually aroused, apply a
firm grip, increasing in speed. Not too fast-just
consistently increasing the speed until you wish to
stop, or orgasm is reached.
 Along with the warnings concerning fingernails
and teeth, perhaps this is a good place to mention
the difference between circumsized and
uncircumsized penises. The extra skin around the
head of an uncircumsized penis makes this area
more sensitive. Pulling the foreskin down from the
head toward the shaft can be painful. Therefore, I
suggest a less rigorous touch when pulling the
foreskin down the shaft, if pulled too far. Whenever
masturbation techniques are used, and as always,
open communication is imperative.
 Masturbation is a wonderful way to get to know
your partner’s body, what pleases him or her, while
providing opportunity for eye contact,
communication, safe sex practices, and as a way to
prevent pregnancy.
89
CHAPTER SIX
AFTER GLOW
The candles are blown out, the music is turned off,
heart and respiratory rates have returned to
normal, and only the after glow remains. So what
is after glow and why is it important to the sexual
experience? Is it more important for women than
for men? Why can’t we just roll over and go to sleep?
 First of all, after glow is very important to the
overall sexual experience. I believe it is as
important to the overall experience as is foreplay.
It is a time for communicating to each other about
the level of pleasure experienced, and to give
thanks to our partners for sharing in the process
of sexual pleasuring.
 It is a time for reaffirming and reassuring your
partner’s skills and techniques, offering
suggestions for greater enhancement and arousal.
After glow offers a sense of completion and
satisfaction to the sexual experience. It is a time
for you to voice sentiments of love and devotion. It
90
SEX TALKS
is a time for intimacy; a shared pillow, and hugging
and cuddling as each of you drift off to sleep.
 Unfortunately, after glow can also be a very
uncomfortable time. Which brings me to the second
question; is it more important for women than for
men? Well, I have never heard of a man
complaining that his partner simply went to sleep
after sex. This doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen, I
just have not come across this complaint from men
in my research, teaching, or counseling.
 However, there are some women who may
become upset if and when their partner rolls over
and immediately goes to sleep after orgasm.
Although I am sure more explanations exist, I will
offer the two most prominent reasons for what we
have come to believe is fairly typical male behavior
(generally speaking, of course!).
 A friend and counselor of mine offered weekly
meetings for men, in which they would discuss a
variety of “male issues.” Many years ago, we were
discussing issues of intimacy and he said that from
his experience—personally, professionally, and in
his work with other men, he believed that men feel
intimacy much more strongly and deeply than
women.
91
 He said after orgasm, the reason men fall asleep,
watch television, eat, or simply leave, is because
the closeness and connection they feel to their
partner is so strong, it actually repels them. He
said it is as if the intensity is too overwhelming, so
in a sense they “go away,” in an effort to avoid the
intense feelings they are experiencing.
 I like this explanation. My hope is that many
women will embrace this story, helping them avoid
taking personal responsibility for their partner’s
“avoidance” behavior.
 Another explanation is simply one of a
physiological nature. Sex is exercise. It is an
exertion on the internal organs, nervous system,
muscular system, as well as, the entire body in
general. After sex there is a release and a state
when the body is once again in a relaxed state
where all systems are functioning at a normal rate.
If your partner (or you for that matter) is relaxed
enough to fall asleep, then perhaps that is a
wonderful testimony to the level of intensity
experienced by you or your partner.
 Of course keep in mind that women are multiorgasmic (capable of reaching orgasm many times)
and the average time (generally speaking) it takes
AFTER GLOW
92
SEX TALKS
a male to achieve another erection (the refractory
period), is approximately twenty minutes.
Therefore, sleep may be more like a nap if both
partners become sexually aroused again.
 Finally, the time after orgasm carries with it a
certain vulnerability and softness. It is truly the
“glow” of the “after” and is of vital importance to
the health and well being of the relationship.
93
PART THREE

SEX TALKS
CHAPTER SEVEN
SACRED SEX
Today, couples are searching for commitments that
offer a spiritual and sacred element in their
relationships. Some of you may be wondering how
the words “sacred” and “sex” can be used together
when they almost seem (at least in our culture) to
be dichotomous in meaning. My hope is that by
the end of this chapter, you will begin to understand
why these two words are perfectly matched.
 A very important part of partnering is in the
sharing of a spiritual connection. Although
experienced in a multitude of ways, a spiritual
connection helps us “Drop Into Soul” with our
partners, seeing them completely through the eyes
of love.
 Much of what is written in the following chapters
may be gender-specific, and the material does seem
to be somewhat age-specific as well. I say this with
reasonable certainty due to the changes in our
relationships that many of us may experience over
the passages of time.
95
 Remember that many relationships are based
on physical attraction. Returning then to our “U,”
we see that the bottom is normally the “make it or
break it” mark. At this stage, we either part ways
or begin to define our relationship in ways that may
include the physical aspects, but are no longer
necessarily dependent upon them. Although the
sexual component is of utmost importance, an
emotional and spiritual connection begins to
increase in meaning and significance.
 If a couple is married, typically their emotional
bonds grow, while their sexual relationship does
not. Over time and as we age, many of us begin to
ask, “Is this it? Is this as good as it gets?” And of
course, we know what the end result is as we
consider that fifty percent of all marriages end in
divorce.
 So how do we avoid becoming a statistic? How
do we escape the clutches of divorce and keep our
marriages exciting and our sex passionately alive
as well?
 In many cases, I believe the answer lies in
creating a relationship based on the union of mind,
body, soul, and spirit. Think of it as holistic
partnering. It is what I hear many people are
SACRED SEX
96
SEX TALKS
seeking in the new millennium. And few people
are willing to settle for less than this in their
relationships, because they understand the value
that lies in this type of union.
 Sacred sex is a very important part of this union.
It allows for full body orgasms, where couples
describe the merging of their bodies as they feel
themselves become one with each other. It has been
described to me as an out-of-body experience. Some
say they visit other places, galaxies, and places
unknown during these moments of perfect harmony
and unity. For the most part, I hear from
individuals and couples that complete sexual and
spiritual union with their partner’s can not even
be described—it can only be felt and experienced.
 Recently I was speaking with my good friend
Fede. He was talking about a recent breakup with
a woman that he said he believed was his soulmate.
He said that he felt connected to this woman in
every way and that although he is now dating
others, nothing he feels for them has come close to
the intimacy and spiritual union he shared with
his previous girlfriend. One of the things he said
they experienced was great sex. After much
discussion, we both agreed that this kind of
97
connection is the pulse of living—the very driving
force that gives our lives meaning.
 My friend said that he has had the experience
of sacred sex. When defining just exactly what it
is, he could only state those things that he has felt.
Others have described it similarly. Sex on a soul
level is what sacred sex is all about. It is the deep
gazing into each other’s eyes, the feel of each touch,
given with deliberation and presence. It is as if the
hundredth touch is as exciting as the first touch. It
is the verbal and the nonverbal statement to our
beloved that we are with him or her—fully present;
one hundred percent in attendance and in
participation of the union of our minds, bodies,
souls, and spirits.
 Strangely enough this idea comes to us from the
East, approximately 5,000 years ago, in the
ultimate form of sacred sex that we have come to
know as “Tantra.”

CHAPTER EIGHT
TANTRA
At the present time I do not claim to be an expert
in Tantra, although someday I intend to be. I am
extremely interested in Tantra as a form of sacred
sex and have read and researched much in this
arena. My intentions are to provide you with the
information that I feel will give you a general basis
for understanding. If you find you are interested
in learning more about Tantra, I suggest you
consider further research and reading. I have
provided a “Bibliography” section at the end of this
book, and many of the books listed are about
Tantra.
What is Tantra?
Tantra is defined as spiritual sexuality. It is closely
associated with yoga and Zen, and is defined as a
path to enlightenment. It can be traced to India as
Hinduism and Buddhism became prevalent around
AD 500.
99
 The word “Tantra” is Sanskrit, the sacred
language of Hinduism. Also from the Sanskrit
language is the word “Kama” that is defined as sex/
love, undivided, and indivisible. The seventh
century Tantric scripture is called the “Kama
Sutra.”
 Tantra is derived from the root word “tan,” which
means to expand, extend, and spread. It specifically
refers to a series of Hindu books written over two
thousand years ago. They contain many disciplines,
meditations, and sexual rituals. Tantra is a
spiritual science, which means it is also mystical.
It blends philosophy, psychology, and physiology.
It is known as an erotic journey of self-discovery.
 Tantra is nicknamed “the science of ecstasy.” Its
focus is on the prolonging of physical contact
between lovers. The philosophy behind Tantra is
that every experience is to be lived with a sense of
sacredness, heightened awareness, and yet with a
playful action. Tantric sex purports that the
greatest source of energy is sexual, and orgasm is
viewed as a divine and cosmic experience.
 Early Hindu practitioners of Tantra experienced
sexual play and sexual union as a form of
celebration. They viewed sex as a form of bonding,
TANTRA
100
SEX TALKS
affirming the union of their souls. Tantric sex is
based on the belief that our partners are divine. In
our partner we are able to find expressions of joy
as we honor him or her. Sex is no longer seen as
just an act resulting in orgasm. Rather, it is viewed
as a very special way to bring awareness and
passion into our everyday consciousness.
 In Tantra, there are no divisions between what
is seen as good and bad or acceptable and
unacceptable. Sexual activity is seen as useful and
of benefit as long as it is not offensive to either
partner. Tantric philosophy does not condemn the
body. It attempts to realize consciousness and
awareness through the senses. From a spiritual
perspective, it offers enlightenment, acceptance,
and unity. Its ultimate goal is spiritual
consciousness. Tantra is in a sense a spiritual
science that delves into the subconscious and
unconscious mind.
 Tantra demands purity of mind. What is most
necessary is that each partner responds toward the
other with utmost respect and honor, thus bringing
a sense of sacredness to the sexual experience.
Tantra encourages unconditional loving. When
approached from a soul level, sex becomes truly
101
sacred and divine. An important aspect of Tantra
is creating a balanced relationship through the act
of equally giving and receiving.
Why Tantra?
Tantra is mainly for sexual and spiritual pleasure.
The main focus is on communication so that
ultimate pleasure may be achieved. From the
sexual aspect, Tantra may help to unify and sustain
a relationship. Its application applies to the growth
potential of individuals and couples. It assists
couples in opening and expanding to
transformational lovemaking and spiritual union.
It is believed to strengthen marriages and spiritual
awareness.
 Tantric sex is believed to promote vitality and
health. As opposed to the belief that sex is for
orgasm only, Tantra’s perspective is that sex is for
physical and harmonious well being and for the
building of sexual energy between partners.
Couples engaging in Tantric practices often refer
to themselves as equals or teammates. They are in
sync with one another. Tantric partners balance
and harmonize their desires, drives, and moods. It
teaches us to expand outside our need to reach
TANTRA
102
SEX TALKS
goals, as orgasm is no longer seen as the most
important aspect of sex. In fact, by focusing on
orgasmic experience, many other pleasures may be
missed.
 Love is the basis for Tantra. The act of sacred
sex is impossible without love, and of utmost
importance is love of Self. Tantra focuses on being
in the moment and the art of touching and being
touched. It is the art of consciously loving your
partner and yourself. With Tantric sex, spiritual
goals are as important as sexual ones.
 Although only ten percent of Tantra is actually
devoted to sexual experiences, it is nonetheless an
important arena to explore and study. If you were
a student of Tantric sexual practices, you would
find yourself immersed in an intensive study of the
mental, physical, and sexual processes. These areas
of study are meant to enhance an awareness of the
senses through the promotion of touch and
exploration. Penetration is avoided to prolong
sexual arousal and orgasm.
 Tantric practices provide couples with exciting
ways to reach altered states, as well as extended
orgasms (both physically and energetically). Men
benefit from Tantra by experiencing energy
103
orgasms. These orgasms are felt as waves of energy
moving throughout the body without ejaculation.
In addition, men learn to honor a woman’s sexuality
and to surrender to her. They are encouraged to
withhold ejaculation as long as possible, and to
engage in the sexual experience sensitively and
sensually, until a woman reaches total sexual
pleasure. Often, women who have been raped or
molested seek Tantric practices as a healing tool
to release pain, anger, and sadness.
 Using all five senses is instrumental in the act
of Tantric sex. Sounds include heartbeats,
breathing, and cries of arousal and pleasure.
Touching includes caressing every square inch of
your beloved’s body. Sight involves the use of eye
contact as you savor the sight of your partner’s
body. Taste is the flavor of the skin, saliva and
genital secretions, while smell provides aromas of
perfume and cologne, incense, candles, soapscented skin, and natural genital scents.
 Sensory exploration includes touching, seeing,
smelling, tasting, and hearing. In Tantra, it is not
necessarily how you sense your partner, but simply
that you sense them on a soulful level. For example,
when you touch your beloved, also look deeply into
TANTRA
104
SEX TALKS
his or her eyes. Use a gentle touch to relax the body
and to stimulate the energy.
 It is believed that before a couple can experience
Tantric sex, each partner must free their minds
from negative attitudes regarding sex. To fully
enjoy the pleasures of Tantra, we must think of
sex in an open and positive way. Then, when
practicing with a willing and loving partner,
physical sex becomes a joyous experience of
freedom, love, and spirituality.
Tantric Techniques
When sacred sex is desired and Tantric practices
utilized, it is important to know the difference
between common and somewhat well known sexual
techniques, and those techniques unique to Tantric
sex. Although the information may seem similar
to that presented in Chapter Eight, I assure you
that the results differ greatly.
 Tantra is not about quick sex. It is not about the
kentucky fried sex spoken of previously. It is not
shake and bake either. It is sacred and honorable
and needs to be treated as such. Therefore, when
engaging in Tantric practices, it is important that
you set aside time for sex. Tantra is based on rituals
105
and these rituals require that you set aside time
for sexual activity.
 Furthermore, because of the sacredness of
Tantra, it is not meant to be experienced or shared
with anyone other than a loving partner. It is not
recommended for couples uncommitted or couples
engaging in casual sex. As a precursor to Tantric
practice, genital hygiene is required.
 So how do you begin? Create a sacred space for
your Tantric practices. Choose a room that is dimly
lit so that candles may offer additional lighting as
well as providing soothing scents to awaken the
sense of smell. Flowers add color to the setting and
you may wish to use feathers or silk scarves to
heighten the sense of touch. Privacy is a necessary
element and you may wish to unplug your
telephone so that you will not be interrupted.
 To ensure proper hygiene, you and your partner
may wish to bathe together. Again, the use of
candles is suggested, and you may wish to have
soft music playing in the background. During the
bathing ceremony, it is important that you bathe
each other and the use of a loofa sponge is advised.
Make sure the water is warm enough so that the
bath is one of leisure, void of time constraints.
TANTRA
106
SEX TALKS
Always the act of being “present” is necessary so
that the connection between you and your partner
is firmly rooted and established.
 Before, during, or after the bath, the feeding
ceremony may be a part of your Tantric practices.
Different types of foods are eaten to heighten the
senses. You may wish to feed certain foods or
beverages to your partner or place them on his or
her body to be licked or eaten. I suggest foods that
are desired by both partners, are bite-size, and are
easily fed to each other.
 Touch is one of the basic senses and is used as a
means to stir and direct energy. When touching or
massaging your partner, let go of any expectations.
Focus on the present and the act of conscious touch.
Try to maintain full hand contact, allowing the
palm of your hand, the fingers, and thumbs to rest
on your partner’s body. Provide a steady flow of
movement.
 Touching is a pleasurable experience and is
referred to as “kissing of the hands.” To enhance
the pleasure, vary the rhythm of the strokes, the
pressure and the tempo. Repeating a stroke over
and over may become boring or painful.
107
 One particular touching technique is called the
“static touch.” Rest both hands upon your partner
and do not move them. Consciously direct the flow
of energy from your right hand into and through
your partner, feeling it return to your left hand.
Another touching method is a gentle pinching and
kneading touch, called “squeezing.” Tapping or
slapping may arouse passion, and here it is of
utmost importance to be conscious of your partner’s
desires. Tantra does not promote sadomasochism
practices.
 Kissing ranges from a small kiss on the cheek
to deep, long, and passionate kisses that release
energy throughout the body. When kissing
sensually, the sexual responses of the body are felt
and passion is ignited. It is believed that by kissing
in a deep and intimate way, the male and female
energies become balanced and harmonized. Tantra
discusses several basic techniques for kissing.
 “Lipping” is the method used to contact the moist
and soft part inside the upper and lower lips.
“Tasting” utilizes the tongue to lick your partner’s
lips and touch the inner cheek or explore the roof
of the mouth and tongue. Nibbling on your partner’s
lips may be considered “love bites” and then there

are the “blowing” and “sucking” kisses which are
used across any and all areas of the face and body.
 A particularly passionate kiss is known as the
“upper lip kiss.” Suck gently on your partner’s
upper lip, using your lips and tongue to gently pull
on the area stretching from inside the upper lip,
directly above the front teeth. This area is known
as the female frenulum and is stimulated in much
the same way as the clitoris. As you suck on your
partner’s upper lip, have her suck on your lower
lip. Visualize the energy that runs from this area
in the mouth to your clitoris. You may experience
clitoral stimulation, and quite possibly orgasm from
this form of kissing. Whether you are touching or
kissing, it is as important to give as it is to receive.
Tantra is about creating balance by equally giving
and receiving.
 Okay, so you have created a sacred space for
loving; have bathed together to ensure cleanliness;
and have been giving and receiving massages and
lots of kisses. Now we begin the most important
aspect of Tantric sex—breathing, which is the
foundation of Tantra. The act of breathing allows
for the energy to freely flow throughout the body.
109
 Tantra practices allow for the breath to help
release the tension in the spine to provide for more
freedom of movement. The key to relaxing is
breathing. The act of breathing deeply allows for
you to fully feel the presence of your body. It is
possible to reach orgasm using only the breath.
 Before we discuss the various techniques for
proper breathing, I suggest you and your partner
sit across from each other, naked, and legs crossed.
Look deeply into each other’s eyes and begin to rock
back and forth. Move your chest forward as you
inhale, and back as you exhale. Breathe in unison
and as you do, you will begin to feel the sexual
energy rise from the genitals upward toward the
heart.
 At this point, you may begin to feel the
boundaries of your own bodies melt away as you
begin to feel a connection that can only be described
as sacred and divine. You may feel as if you are
nowhere and everywhere all at the same time.
Words may be useless as you speak a thousand
words through the language of your eyes. You may
feel a quintessential and unifying love as you and
your partner become one with God.

 As you continue rocking, utilize the
“Harmonizing Breath” which requires both of you
to breathe simultaneously, holding the breath for
several seconds before exhaling. After several
minutes, a second technique called “Reciprocal
Charging” may begin. This breathing method
involves opposite breathing, where one partner
inhales as the other exhales. It is important to gaze
into each other’s eyes and feel the energy as it
moves in and out with each inhale and exhale.
 This is a good time for the woman to straddle
her partner with her legs wrapped around his back.
He is still sitting in a crossed leg position and she
simply crosses her legs at the ankles, behind his
back. This position is called the “Mula Bandha”
(Root or Basal Lock). Avoid penetration at this time.
Continue rocking and breathing using a variation
of the “Reciprocal Charging” and “Cosmic
Intercourse” techniques.
 The “Cosmic Intercourse” breathing technique
includes four parts: slow inhalation; several
seconds of held breath; slow exhalation; and holding
of the breath or a pause before beginning the next
inhalation. First, inhale slowly. Then hold the
111
breath for several seconds. Slowly release the
breath, pause, and begin again.
 Remember to focus on the exchange of energy
as you both are giving and receiving energy from
each other. Gaze into your partner’s eyes, thinking
about the love that you feel for him or her and focus
on the wonderful qualities that initially attracted
you to each other.
 Breathing techniques can help a man delay
ejaculation. If he feels that he is going to reach
orgasm before he and his partner are ready, he may
wish to visualize the semen moving away from his
genitals as he inhales; pulling the breath and the
semen toward the heart.
 Many of the techniques used to help preserve or
control ejaculation are used in an effort for men to
have greater pleasure during the sexual experience.
Although ejaculation is important, it is not the sole
purpose for lovemaking. According to Tantric
practices, the difference between orgasm and
ejaculation is that ejaculation is external and
orgasm is internal.
 Internal methods for ejaculation control are
pelvic contraction (PC) muscle manipulation,
shifting focus, and breath control. The PC muscle
TANTRA
112
SEX TALKS
manipulation technique (also known as the “Kegel”
exercise) is important because, by building a strong
PC muscle, men may obtain harder erections and
experience longer lasting orgasms. A strong PC
muscle is beneficial in creating more intense
orgasms for both men and women. The PC muscles
are the ones used to stop the flow of urine during
urination. To test for the strength or weakness of
these muscles, contract the internal pelvic muscles
while urinating. To strengthen them, make a habit
to squeeze these muscles at least twice during
urination.
 As previously mentioned, breathing is normally
quickened as orgasm nears. Many of us tend to
breathe from the top of the chest, in short and
shallow breaths. By slowing and deepening the
breath, it will help change the focus and energy
flow to delay ejaculation.
 The external practices include the technique
known as “the pull.” As you near ejaculation, either
you or your partner may pull down on the scrotum,
holding it firmly for thirty seconds. Do not squeeze
the testicles as this may cause a painful sensation.
Another external technique is to apply pressure to
the base of the penis. Again, apply a firm pressure
113
for approximately thirty seconds. Lastly, is a
technique called the “squeeze” and involves
squeezing the area around the frenulum.
 Tantra teaches men how to achieve “energy
orgasms.” These are often referred to as full body
orgasms, void of ejaculatory fluid. Some men say
it is like riding an orgasmic wave—without the
water. In addition to controlling premature
ejaculation, a technique used to create energy
orgasms is to stop all forms of stimulation as you
feel yourself coming close to the edge of ejaculating.
Relax the genital and anal muscles while you
continue taking slow and deep breaths. To further
delay ejaculation, press your tongue against the
roof of your mouth. Repeat these processes as much
as necessary.
 The benefits of ejaculation control are many.
Those practicing Tantra believe that a man’s
ejaculatory fluid is the release of positively charged
energy, which explains much of his fatigue after
sexual activity. On the other hand, women release
a negative charge, creating feelings of renewal and
restored energy. When a man controls the release
of his energy by delaying and even avoiding
ejaculation, both partners greatly benefit.
TANTRA

 I have spoken with men who claim to have
experienced orgasms without ejaculatory fluid.
They confessed that when it first happened, it was
somewhat frightening, as they had never known
that this was a possibility. However, they all agreed
that the orgasmic feeling was one that was felt
throughout their bodies and was a greatly desired
experience.
 Now that you are aware of the various methods
for ejaculation control, you are ready to move into
the arena of sexual contact. First, we will discuss
the experience of oral sex. The importance of oral
sex in adulthood is not surprising. Consider that
an infant’s first experience of comfort and pleasure
comes from the breast as he or she seeks to reduce
hunger. A child may then begin to suck the thumb
and attempts to place a variety of objects into the
mouth.
 The level of saliva in the mouth is based on one’s
emotional state. If the mouth is parched and dry,
it may be due to fear. During a sexually excited
state, the mouth may fill with saliva. Similarly,
we find the same holds true for the vagina.
 One position for oral pleasuring is called
“Kakisana.” In American culture we call this
115
position “Sixty-nine.” Lie on your right sides, facing
each other, with your heads opposite your genital
regions. If you are a man, you will place your right
hand underneath your partner’s thighs, cradling
your head between them. Now lick your right
thumb and index finger and place your index finger
over her anus in an effort to create a seal. The
thumb is then placed gently inside the vagina. Place
your mouth and tongue on her Labia Majora and
Labia Minora (outer and inner lip areas), gently
licking and stroking the clitoris.
 If you are a woman, lick the middle finger of
your left hand and place it over your partner’s anus,
again creating a seal. Use the other fingers and
the thumb of your right hand to touch and caress
his scrotum. Place his penis into your mouth and
caress his perineum, testicles, and penis. (See
Chapter Seven for more detailed instructions.) If
desired, both partners may simultaneously reach
orgasm.
 One very intimate experience is to share the
semen through a kiss after orgasm (providing there
is fluid). If you wish for your semen to be sweeter
in taste, try eating raw vegetables and fruit. Eating
TANTRA
116
SEX TALKS
meat, taking certain medications, and experiencing
stress can give the semen a bitter taste.
 A recommended position for intercourse is the
“Circle Dance from the Hips.” If you are male you
will lie on your back while your partner sits astride
you, your penis inside of her. The woman then is
able to vary the motion and speed, lifting herself
up slightly and then lowering slowly. Maintain eye
contact and communicate always and all ways
about what does and does not feel pleasurable.
Continue the breathing techniques and conscious
energy exchanges.
 Remember the “Mula Bandha?” The man is in
lotus posture, woman astride with her legs wrapped
around his back, her feet either crossed at the
ankles or resting on the floor or bed. If necessary,
place a pillow, towel, or blanket under her buttocks
for extra support. For purposes of intercourse, now
insert the penis into the vagina (check for
lubrication). Grasp each other’s wrists and lean
back, holding onto each other for support. Either
you or your partner can control the movement of
penetration. With this position, perhaps the most
pleasure is experienced as you pull each other close
117
and then vary the level of friction and penetration
as you lean back again.
 Another position is called the “Yoni Asana” or
the “Womb” posture. Your male partner sits in a
chair with his legs bent at the knees, the soles of
his feet resting on the floor. You will then straddle
him and wrap your arms around his neck. With
this position, you may find it easy to adjust the
depth of penetration and the angle of the penis.
 Tantric sex offers a variety of motions for
penetration. In addition to a back-and-forth motion,
the circular pelvic and side-to-side movements are
also suggested. These variations are pleasant for
both partners and assist in delaying ejaculation.
 The angle of entry also influences pleasure. By
varying the angle of penetration, it is possible to
heighten the sexual experience, delay ejaculation,
and enhance the orgasmic experience.
 By learning to respond to each other’s emotional
and physical needs and through methods of
harmonizing and balancing, patterns of arousal and
orgasm are achieved. To restore balance and
harmony or even simply to maintain them, it is
important to remember and to practice the basics
of Tantric sex. These include maintaining an open
TANTRA
118
SEX TALKS
mind and heart, and engaging in a “nurturing
meditation” (spoon position) for at least ten minutes
a day, particularly when you feel tired or stressed.
 Learn to consciously communicate. By deeply
appreciating each other the energies of passion and
intimacy are freely experienced and greatly
enhance the quality of the sexual experience.
 In addition, squeeze the PC muscles every day
and practice the breathing techniques every day,
as well. Men, do not ejaculate one out of every four
times you engage in sexual activity (even
masturbation), and after intercourse stay
physically connected with your partner. In fact, one
of the requirements of Tantra is that you remain
inside your partner, even in a softened state.
 Don’t become impatient if you find these
practices and techniques uncomfortable or
awkward. Tantra is an art form and it takes time
to become an accomplished practitioner. Remember
that, in Tantra, every touch is a conscious touch.
Keep your eyes open as much as possible in an effort
to keep the bond of intimacy flowing freely.
Exchange energy by equally giving and receiving.
Finally, always regard your body and your partner’s
body as divine and sacred.
